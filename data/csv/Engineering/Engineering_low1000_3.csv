J,"Alaie, MB; Olamaei, SA",Design of unimodular sequences with small PSL,"In this paper, we address the intra-pulse coding for single-input single-output radar systems. As the design metric, we consider the peak sidelobe level (PSL), which is important to be small to avoid masking of the weak targets in the range sidelobes of a strong target. The optimization problem, i.e., minimizing the PSL, is Np-hard in general. The adopted constraint is constant modulus, which is practically important in radar systems, as transmit power amplifiers are typically working in saturation, i.e., transmitting constant amplitude probing signals. The imposed constraint is non-convex that increases the complexity of the problem. By the mathematical manipulation proposed in this paper, we convert the non-convex problem to a convex one and tackle it using semidefinite programming. Simulation and results show the obtained sequences have very small PSL values.",10.1007/s11760-019-01610-5
J,"Bendak, S; Alhammadi, AA",A multi-criteria decision-making approach to minimising fire risk in detached house designs,"Purpose House fire risk would be minimised if fire safety principles were incorporated at the design stage. This issue is rarely addressed in the literature. The purpose of this study is to propose a multi-criteria decision-making framework to evaluate fire risk of detached house designs in the United Arab Emirates and countries of similar cultural background. Design/methodology/approach The framework was developed based on function areas where (detached) house fires start, expert opinion and recommendations derived from the published literature on residential fire safety. This framework was applied to a sample of ten public detached house designs to check the applicability of the framework and to determine how safe these designs are from a fire safety perspective. Findings The proposed framework is proven to be an effective preliminary fire risk evaluation tool of detached house designs, and more research is needed in this area. Research limitations/implications - The proposed framework is an encouraging first step in incorporating fire risk minimisation at the design stage of detached houses based on determining the preferred location of function areas but requires further development and validation, especially in other design settings. Practical implications The proposed framework is an initial endeavour in helping designers of detached houses to minimise fire risk and its potential effects on residents. Originality/value This research proposes a way to minimise fire risk at the design stage of detached houses.",10.1108/JEDT-10-2018-0195
J,"Chen, RS; Wong, SW; Niu, BJ; Lin, JY; Li, Y; Zhang, L; Wang, Y; He, YJ",High selectivity band-stop filters using coaxial-fed substrate integrated waveguide,"A novel band-stop filter (BSF) using coaxial-fed slotted substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is proposed in this article. The proposed BSF is designed using coaxial-fed line with extended probes penetrating through the substrate and connecting each other, instead of using the main transmission line to dispose the resonators. The SIW cavities perform the resonators excited by the probes to produce a stopband. Then, two BSFs with one and two SIW cavities are firstly designed, both of them have SIW cavity resonator modes and lower-band reflection zeroes. Then, two types of third-order BSFs using two cavity resonators and one slot resonator are presented, the high selectivity is achieved by the RZs at both sides of the stopband. Finally, one of the proposed third-order BSFs is fabricated and measured to verify the design method.",10.1002/mop.32183
J,"Joo, J; Song, E",Investigation of Conducted Noise Impact on Conducted Susceptibility Testing for a Wireless Power Transfer System with Bifurcation Phenomena,"This paper presents the modeling of bifurcation phenomena in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system along with its application in the testing of conducted susceptibility (CS). The presented model represents an analytic transfer function based on the equivalent circuit models of strongly coupled coils, and its validation was performed using a simple WPT system designed and fabricated as equipment under test (EUT). Additionally, experimental verification of effectiveness of the presented model was performed via transfer-function measurement. The presented model was applied to estimate the impact of conducted noise on measurement-based CS testing of WPT systems demonstrating bifurcation phenomena. Results obtained in this investigation demonstrate that the impact of conducted noise with bifurcation phenomena can be successfully estimated using the presented model.",10.1007/s42835-019-00329-0
J,"Lorenzo, D; Romero, A; Del-Arco, L; Santos, A",Transformation of Cyclic Ketones as Impurities in Cyclohexanone in the Caprolactam Production Process,"Nylon 6 fibers are produced by polymerization of caprolactam obtained after oximation and Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone. For this reason, the purity of cyclohexanone used is an important parameter to control the quality of final nylon 6 products. The poor quality of cyclohexanone is related to the presence of some cyclic ketone impurities, such as 2-methylcyclopentanone, n-methylcyclohexanones (n = 2, 3, and 4), and 2-cyclohexen-1-one, which can remain after the purification process of cyclohexanone. In this study, the first step was to study the products promoted during the oximation of these cyclic impurities. The oximation of each impurity was carried out at T = 80 degrees C and pH = 5, and the reaction products were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and NMR Each cyclic oxime promoted a mixture of cis and trans stereoisomers, and the relative production ratio was determined. Additionally, the operating conditions that can affect the oximation step were studied. To do that, cyclohexanone was spiked with the mentioned cyclic impurities, and the oximation reaction was carried out using an aqueous solution of hydroxylammonium sulfate. The effects of experimental conditions, such as temperature (353.15-358.15 K) and pH (3.5-6), were studied. It was found that the higher the temperature, the higher the impurity conversion. However, when the pH was studied, the conversion of impurities presented a maximum due to the oximation mechanism. Additionally, a kinetic model of oximation reaction of cyclohexanone spiked with the cyclic impurities, based on an apparent constant to take into account that the reaction was carried out in two liquid phases, was proposed to explain the experimental results. The apparent kinetic constants obtained for 2-methylcyclohexanone and 2-cyclohexen-1-one were similar but lower than that for 2-methylcyclopentanone. The study was completed promoting the Beckmann rearrangement of the oxime mixtures obtained from the oximation of pure cyclic impurities under mild conditions (sulfuric media at 100 degrees C). The amides produced were identified by gas chromatograph/mass selective detector (GC/MSD). Cis/trans oxime stereoisomers from n-methylcyclohexanones (n = 2 and 3) and 2-methylcydopentanone presented the same reactivity to the corresponding amides, but only(Z)-2-cyclohexen-1-one oxime reacts in the Beckmann rearrangement to produce its cyclic amide.",10.1021/acs.iecr.9b04982
J,"McMaster, LP",Method for Approximating and Interpreting Transport Properties for a Homologous Series of Solid Polymer Electrolytes,"A new method approximates transport properties of a homologous series of poly(oxyethylene-ethylene carbonate) copolymer-lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs)-using both dilute and concentrated solution theories. A chemical equilibrium model uses published Fourier-transform infrared data to estimate the concentrations of positively charged ion aggregates, of free anions and negatively charged ion aggregates, of charge-balanced ion aggregates, and of lithium ion adducts with ether and carbonyl oxygen groups in the copolymer. Ion shuttle-hopping and bulk self-diffusivities are estimated using published cation transference number, glass transition temperature, and ionic conductivity data using species concentrations from the chemical equilibrium model. Over a broad range of copolymer composition, salt concentration, and temperature, both ion shuttle-hopping and bulk diffusion contribute to ion transport. The method has been more generally validated for homogeneous and amorphous solid polymer electrolytes consisting of polymers containing aliphatic ether and carbonate groups with LiFSI and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, including polyethylene oxide SPEs.",10.1021/acs.iecr.9b01676
J,"Romana Giraldo, J; Bryson, LS; Gutierrez Soto, M",Performance of Two Anchored Walls Under Cut and Fill Construction Sequences,"Tieback walls are typically designed using apparent earth pressures that are obtained initially by back-calculating earth pressures from measured support loads for excavation only. For construction activities involving both excavation and backfilling aspects, the use of apparent earth pressures might not be adequate. This paper investigates the performance of two tieback walls constructed using a combination of fill and cut construction sequences. Results obtained from data collected using load cells and strain gages along with the soldier piles of both walls, show the correlation of axial loads and bending moments to construction activities. Results show that some load is transferred to the soldier piles during anchor installation, despite using steel casings to prevent this action. Backfilling behind the wall created significant curvature in the soldier piles based on the measured bending moments. Moreover, results evidence that the apparent earth pressure does not reflect the observed bending moments in the walls. However, a beam model including lateral displacement is presented to represent the measured response in both walls. The results unveil differences in anchor loads estimations, evaluates the appropriateness of apparent earth pressures for the design of tieback walls and provides design recommendations.",10.1007/s10706-019-01131-5
J,"Shojaeian, A; Askari, F",Reliability of Static and Seismic Design of Near Slope Shallow Foundations Following Iranian Code and Eurocode 7,"In geotechnical engineering, probability theory can be implemented regarding a reliability-based design to investigate the probability of failure. In this research, a practical probabilistic approach is used to calculate the reliability of a footing design by applying the first-order reliability method (FORM). The reliability and design risk level of deterministic approaches proposed by Iranian code and Eurocode 7 is evaluated. Both the static and seismic designs have been discussed. The distance of the foundation, both near the crest of the slope and away from it, has also been considered. An entire analysis has been done regarding the three most important different soil types to investigate the effect of soil shear strength parameters on reliability. Although the Iranian code presented a more conservative result than Eurocode 7 did in the static design, there was no tangible difference in the seismic mode. Generally, target reliability was not satisfied in any of the deterministic design approaches. In cases where shallow foundations were located near the crest of the slopes, the difference in the results of RBD and deterministic methods would increase. Finally, it can be concluded that the soil type plays an important role in the results obtained from the Iranian code. In granular soils, the reliability of designs based on Iranian code is low (beta = 1.80), so this may be a high risk, which should be considered. On the contrary, the best circumstance (beta = 3.40) was related to the foundations that are based on cohesive soils.",10.1007/s40999-019-00484-5
J,"Tang, X; Li, J; Zeng, M; Huang, YJ; Guo, JQ",The preparation and electrochemical study of LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathode material for lithium-ion battery,"To improve the cycling performance of nickel-rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material, many methods have been studied to reduce cation mixing degree, improve layered structure and modify particle morphology, including doping elements, coating metal oxides and morphology control (spherical, nanoflower, core-shell structure, etc.). In this paper, a new gradient calcination process through four-step temperature gradients is applied to synthesize LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material synthesized by gradient calcination shows more excellent electrochemical performance than traditional method. The XRD results indicate that the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material produced by four-step calcination shows lower cation mixing degree and better crystallinity. In addition, the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode produced by gradient calcination presents the highest initial capacity (177.9 mAh g(-1)) and a retention of 82.07% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the material shows the best electrochemical properties when the final temperature in these steps is 820 degrees C. Our results explain the reason why the thermal stability and electrochemical performance could be improved by gradient calcination from the aspect of material crystallinity, crystal defects, cation mixing degree and the completeness of the layered structure.",10.1007/s10854-019-02600-6
J,"Vakilinia, S; Elbiaze, H; Ebrahimi, D",Dynamic process location management in 5G,"5G, as the next generation of wireless networks, promises very high throughput and low latency to mobile users that calls for a substantial innovation in computing management platforms to attend QoS metrics. Thanks to emerging technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN)/network function virtualization (NFV), many features are available in 5G design to detect and control two types of latency caused by computation and communication. In this paper, taking features of caching mechanisms and SDN into the account, a platform is proposed to minimize latency in 5G via caching big flows intelligently and avoiding bottlenecks that may cause by virtualized computing components. First, the pioneering idea of compromising between the cloud radio access network (CRAN) and mobile edge computing (MEC)/information-centric network (ICN) via dynamic processing location management platform is investigated. Accordingly, a mathematical optimization problem to minimize the average latency is formulated. Due to the problem complexity, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to treat the latency via dynamic orchestration of processing functionalities. Through numerical results, the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed, and the simulations corroborate our analytical results and illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with acceptable optimality gap.",10.1002/dac.4063
J,"Akbal, B",High-voltage cable bonding to prevent cable termination faults based on zero-sequence current,"Zero-sequence current (ZC) occurs due to harmonics and unbalanced loading current. ZC increases the sheath voltage (SV) and cable temperature, so cable faults occur on cable terminations in high-voltage underground cable lines (HVUCL). In literature, bonding methods are used to prevent ZC effects, but these methods are not adequate to prevent ZC effects for long HVUCL under high harmonic distortion because ZC is not considered when these methods are designed. In this study, the modified sectional solid bonding (MSSB) is suggested for long HVUCL that works under high harmonic distortion rate and unbalanced loading conditions. Namely, ZC is considered when MSSB is designed. MSSB parameters should be determined before HVUCL is installed for the most economical and practical bonding. SV of HVUCL should be known to determine MSSB parameters, so SV of HVUCL is forecasted by using adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural networks (ANN), and hybrid ANN. Training and forecasting errors of hybrid ANN are less than ANFIS and ANN methods, so hybrid ANN methods are suggested to forecast SV of HVUCL. Also, MSSB parameters should be optimized, so optimization methods are used for optimization of MSSB. When MSSB method is used for bonding of long HVUCL, harmonic distortion rate and SV in cable terminations are not exceeded the determined limits to prevent cable faults.",10.1002/2050-7038.12212

Compared with the traditional air stripline structure, the weight of proposed structure is reduced by more than 80% with the transmission loss slightly increases. The transmission loss of this stripline structure is significantly lower than that of PCB and low-temperature cofired ceramic stripline structure. A section of transmission line is fabricated and measured for verification; the measured results are in good agreement with the theoretical simulation, and it shows about 0.1 dB per 100 mm of transmission loss at C band.",10.1002/mop.32180
J,"Hermansyah, H; Kumaraningrum, AR; Sommeng, AN; Wijanarko, A; Sahlan, M; Shariff, AM",Semi-quantitative risk assessment on the impact of port development to wellhead platform,"An offshore company intends to develop a new field by installing two wellhead platforms to accommodate the well production from this field. Based on port development plans, the locations of these platforms are closed to port dumping and commercial anchorage areas. This can affect the platform's safety. Therefore, risk assessment and mitigation studies are required to forecast the impact of the new wellhead platform project. In this research, a risk analysis was conducted using a semi-quantitative risk analysis method to determine the value of total external risk that affects the safety of platforms and security of personnel. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to identify the maximum likelihood factors that affect the risk values of platforms. The values for the new platforms were found to high-risk levels. To ensure that the risks are more tolerable, risk mitigation tasks need to be executed. Such tasks should be conducted by the company and related governmental bodies, such that the risk value, can be reduced to medium risk level. The typical risk factor developed in this research can be used by related stakeholders to determine the risk value for the impact of port development on platforms during construction and operation.",10.1002/prs.12117

All circuit and field equations are rewritten to obtain final matrix of the system. The developed model opens a way to improve electrical machine simulators, on the basis of finite element method (FEM), to obtain a more accurate voltage distribution waveform at each turn of the coil in fast transients and to increase frequency validity of the modeled machine by RLC method using the FEM.",10.1002/2050-7038.12273
J,"Kaheni, M; Zarif, MH; Kalat, AA; Fadali, MS",Pole Path Assignment of Constrained SISO Affine Nonlinear Systems,"This paper proposes a feedback linearization control scheme for affine nonlinear systems with a constrained control signal where a fast response is required. Instead of placing the linearized system poles at exact locations, ray-like paths in the left hand plane are selected where the poles can freely vary to efficiently exploit the admissible input signal range to increase the speed of response. A stability test for the proposed method is derived via the multivariable circle criterion and the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma. Simulation results demonstrate how the method significantly increases the speed of response in spite of the input constraints compared to fixed pole placement.",10.1007/s40998-019-00203-9
J,"Köhler, S; Husmann, H; Corbean, D; Groche, P",Analytical modelling of buckling in stringer sheet forming,"Stringer sheet forming enables an efficient production of branched sheet metal structures. Compared to conventional sheet metal components, stringer sheets show a significant increase in stiffness and therefore offer new possibilities for lightweight design. A challenge in stringer sheet forming is the failure due to instability, which appears in the buckling of the stringer in concave curvatures. The prediction of this failure mode is so far only possible by complex numerical simulations. This work introduces an analytical model for the prediction of the buckling failure during forming of concave stringer sheet curvatures under different process boundary conditions. It is derived from Kirchhoff's plate theory. A detailed sensitivity analysis of all influencing parameters is shown and extends the process understanding. The model is validated by means of a 4-point bending test and a stamping process. It can be used for a conservative estimation of the buckling failure limit in stringer sheet forming.",10.1007/s12289-019-01518-y
J,"Margottini, C",Leonardo da Vinci and landslides,"Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519 CE) was one of the most productive geniuses in history. He was painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. He also studied rocks and landscapes to improve the realism of his paintings, as well as to increase his knowledge about the surface earth geohazards, in terms of heavy rainfall, floods, and even landslides. The relationship between Leonardo and landslides was never investigated before. For the first time, the present article investigates a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, dating back to 1482-1485, in which he set up a precise description of a rock slump/fall, with its crown, upper scarp, surface of rupture, and debris deposit. This is remarkable as it contributes to expand the scientific dimension of Leonardo, and also calls to a proper consideration about geomorphological hazards inside his studies. This relationship is confirmed by a second drawing by Leonardo, ca. 1512-1518, in which he drew a rock fall at the very moment of collapse, while impacting on two rupestrian settlements. The present article, re-interpreting some material produced by one of the fathers of modern science, is also a tribute of the journal ""Landslide"" to Leonardo da Vinci, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of his passing away.",10.1007/s10346-019-01326-0
J,"Marulanda-Bernal, JI; Gallo-Castrillón, WH; Mosquera-Palacio, DM",Microwave Frequency Characterization of Barium Titanate Films Obtained Via Sol-Gel,"The present work focuses on the structural, morphological and dielectric characterization of barium titanate films (BTO or BaTiO3 due to its chemical formula) deposited by spin coating on crystalline silicon (Si) substrates and CPW resonators using the Sol-Gel technique with a Ba/Ti molar ratio of 0.5/0.5. The coplanar waveguides were manufactured on alumina substrates (Al2O3) with 3 mu m of gold (Au) metallization using the laser ablation technique. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with X-ray energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS) showed the existence of a BTO film with an elementary composition of 14.62% barium and 5.65% titanium, with a thickness of 0.77 mu m measured using the profilometric mode of the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Dielectric characterization was carried out by comparing the frequency response (parameter S-21) of a CPW resonator with deposited BTO film and another reference resonator (without film) using a network vector analyzer (VNA). These measurements are compared in turn with computational simulations to obtain the dielectric properties. For the BTO film was determined a relative dielectric constant constant (epsilon r) of 160 with a loss tangent (Tan delta) of 0.012 for a frequency of 3.60 GHz. The dielectric constant constant and the ferroelectric property of the material produced are quite promising for applications in microwave circuits, such as miniaturization and tuning.",10.19053/01211129.v29.n54.2020.10416
J,"Rashidi, B; Akhavein, A; Najafi, M",Application of Modified Impedance Matrix to Determine an Initial Solution for Reactive-Power Compensation Problem,"As an optimization problem, reactive-power compensation (RPC) in distribution networks has variety of technical and economical objectives and constraints. In order to solve the RPC problem, classic and heuristic methods have been applied. In distributed networks with large amounts of equipment, the RPC has a large dimension which could be a challenge for the aforementioned methods. So, having an initial guess or solution for buses that are suitable for compensator installation, lessens the mentioned challenge and thus improves performance of the solution procedures. Applying extended impedance matrix, this paper proposes a method to determine initial solution for the RPC problem. ""Extended"" means loads connected to buses are included in the impedance matrix. Inclusion of loads in the matrix gives more realistic initial solutions. The rationale behind it is that buses with more loads usually need more reactive composition. Two ranking lists of the buses that could be nominated for RPC have been considered in this paper: One list is obtained by the proposed method, and the other by the sensitivity analysis. Comparison of the mentioned lists in two typical distribution systems shows acceptable performance of the proposed method.",10.1007/s40998-019-00216-4

In this study, an optimisation algorithm for electric field inverse calculation is proposed, which enables non-destructive detection of voltage on overhead transmission lines, enhances the robustness of the algorithm and improves the accuracy of calculation. Firstly, 2D and 3D calculation models of electric field are established. A multimedium calculation model with the operating environment of transmission lines considered is proposed. Based on the multimedium calculation method, the calculation environment is categorised into soil, vegetation, geology, and other media, and the correctness of the optimisation method is verified by the finite-element method-based model. Secondly, in order to eliminate the measurement noise and electric field distortion to the electric field measurement data, a modified model based on Kalman filter is constructed. Both multimedium calculation method and Kalman filter are applied to the inverse calculation of electric field as an optimisation electric field inverse solving algorithm. Finally, the inverse optimisation method is applied to 220 kV transmission lines and practical 500 kV ultra-high voltage transmission lines, respectively, to improve the accuracy and robustness of calculation.",10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.0459
J,"Cao, XY; Zhang, JL; Li, HR",Slotted waveguide antenna with central trapped wave effect,"A new slotted waveguide antenna is proposed in this paper, which opens eight parallel slots along the longitudinal axis at the broad wall of the waveguide as radiation output facets. It has compact slot structure, which greatly reduces the size of the antenna, and the overall longitudinal size of the parallel slot facet is merely 3.8 mm (just slightly larger than half of the operating wavelength). The slot linear array design of the antenna achieves the central trapped wave radiation effect, avoids energy consumption at communication discontinuous zone, and enhances radiation efficiency. The operating bandwidth could be up to 10 GHz, with the center frequency of 85 GHz. The measured results match well with simulated results, and the gain is slightly higher than 9.0 dBi within the whole operating frequency range.

J,"Chan, CC; Lin, SK; Lin, YC",Monitoring the setting process of mortar by a simple mechanical test,"The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using a simple mechanical test to determine the setting time of mortar. The simple mechanical test was carried out on a cantilever PVC pipe filled with fresh mortar. The flexural strain response over time was monitored to investigate the setting process of mortar. The estimated setting time could be compared with that determined by the penetration resistance method. The experimental results show that the strain response of the PVC pipe and mortar can be divided into two stages. The first stage is that the cement mortar has not yet become plastic, and the flexural stress is mainly borne by the PVC pipe. The second stage is that the mortar has become plastic and gradually rigidified and has the ability to bear the flexural stress so that the strain of the PVC pipe decreases with time. Both the initial and final setting times of mortar obtained from the flexural test were in good agreement with those determined by the penetration resistance method. The proposed flexural test can be applied directly to measurement of the setting time of concrete without a need to remove the coarse aggregates larger than #4.",10.1080/02533839.2019.1694441
J,"Ermakova, EN; Pershin, AV; Ryabov, AV; Schennikov, AV; Akchurin, AD",Influence of Horizontal Ionosphere Nonuniformity on the Spatial Distribution of Ultralow-Frequency Magnetic Fields from Ground-Based Sources,"A significant difference was found in the amplitude and polarization spectra of ULF magnetic noise at stations with a base of 120 km during periods of absence of regional thunderstorm activity. A simultaneous analysis of low-frequency data and ionosonde data allowed us to conclude that the difference in the main parameters of the polarization spectrum at two stations is due to the appearance of sporadic E-s layers having a nonuniform horizontal intensity distribution with characteristic scales of the order of the base between stations. A difference in the depth of variations in the polarization parameter epsilon was also found during the ionosphere recovery after magnetic storms. It could be related with Es layers, which had not only a nonuniform intensity distribution, but were also located at different altitudes. A difference was found in the frequency scales of the spectral resonance structure during recording of time variations of its fundamental frequencies. Numerical calculations of the parameter epsilon with specifying model E-s layers and electron-density profiles corrected at the altitudes of the ionospheric F layer adequately explained the observed difference in the magnetic noise spectra and allowed us to determine the altitudes at which the horizontal ionospheric irregularity existed. The studies were carried out on the basis of records of horizontal magnetic components at Radiophysical Research Institute midlatitude observatories Novaya Zhizn (56 degrees N, 45.74 degrees E) and Staraya Pustyn (55.66 degrees N, 43.63 degrees E, 120 km east of the first reception point).",10.1007/s11141-019-09979-6

That is why, the risk analysis and the study of various effects of different factors that could potentially represent a hazard to a safe long term operation are necessary. The methodology for fatigue dimensions of the Pressurized Water Reactor components (PWR) is based on the use of design curves established from test carried out in air at 20 degrees C on smooth specimens by integrating safety coefficient that covers the dispersion of tests associated with the effects of structures. To formally integrate these effects, some international codes have already proposed and suggested a modification of the austenitic stainless steels fatigue curve combined with a calculation of an environmental penalty factor, namely Fen, which has to be multiplied by the usual fatigue usage factor. The aim of this paper is to present a new device ""FABIME2E"" developed in the CEA-LISN in collaboration with EDF and AREVA.

J,"Kenchappa, B; Chikmath, L; Dattaguru, B",A study on prognostic analysis of attachment lugs under off-axis loading,"Purpose Lug joints with fasteners play a crucial role in connecting many major components of the aircraft. Most of the failures in the past were credited to the damages initiating and progressing from these types of joints. Ensuring the structural integrity of these fastener joints is a major issue in many engineering structures, especially in aerospace components, which would otherwise lead to fatal failure. The purpose of this paper is to adopting the prognostic approach for analysing these lug joints with fasteners subjected to off-axis loading by estimating the crack initiation and crack growth life of these joints. This data will be useful to estimate the remaining life of these joints at any given stage of operations, which is mandatory in structural health monitoring (SHM). Design/methodology/approach Straight and tapered lug joints are modelled using the finite element method in MSC PATRAN and analysed in MSC NASTRAN. These lug joints are analysed with a push fit fastener. The contact/separation regions at the pin-lug interface are carefully monitored throughout the analysis for various loading conditions. Critical locations in these lug joints are identified through stress analysis. Fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack growth analysed is carried out at these locations for different load ratios. A computational method is proposed to estimate the cycles to reach crack initiation and cycles at which the crack in the lug joint become critical by integrating several known techniques. Findings Analysis carried out in this paper describes the importance of tapered lug joints, particularly when subjected to non-conventional way of loading, i.e. off-axis loading. There is a partial loss of contact between pin and lug upon pin loading, and this does not change further with monotonically increasing pin load. But during load reversals, there is a change in contact/separation regions which is effectively handled by inequality constraints in the boundary conditions. Crack growth in these lug joints pertains to mixed-mode cracking and is computed through the MVCCI technique. Originality/value Most of the earlier works were carried out on in-plane pin loading along the axis of symmetry of the lug. The current work considers the off-axis pin loading by loading the lug joints with transverse and oblique pin load. The significance of taper angle under such loading condition is brought in this paper. The results obtained in this paper through prognostic approach are of direct relevance to the SHM and damage tolerance design approach where the safety of the structural components is of foremost priority.",10.1108/IJSI-10-2018-0075

J,"Li, Z; Wu, W; Gong, P; Zhang, XF",Unfolded coprime bistatic MIMO radar for joint DOD and DOA estimation: from viewpoint on aperture augment for sum coarray,"Generally, the coprime linear array (CLA) consisting of two interleaved uniform linear subarrays can enlarge the array aperture to attain the better angle estimation performance compared with the uniform linear array (ULA). In this paper, we ulteriorly study the virtual sum coarray of the unfolded coprime (UC) bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar whose transmitter and receiver array are both unfolded CLA from the viewpoint on the geometry and array aperture. The UC MIMO radar can be exploited to obtain the better joint direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation performance due to the larger array aperture. Furthermore, we propose an all sum coarray multiple signals classification (ASCA-MUSIC) algorithm for the UC MIMO radar. ASCA-MUSIC can fully exploit all the degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the sum coarray and can obtain the better estimation performance. We also prove that ASCA-MUSIC can avoid the phase ambiguity problem due to the coprime property. In addition, we devise a reduced complexity scheme for ASCA-MUSIC to reduce the high computational complexity and utilize Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) as a benchmark for the lower bound on the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of unbiased angle estimation. Finally, the numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the UC MIMO radar, ASCA-MUSIC and the reduced complexity scheme.",10.1080/00207217.2019.1636299

J,"Aalae, B; Abderrahmane, H; Gael, M",Metamodel-assisted Kalai-Smorodinsky equilibria to solve a multicriteria optimization problem shape optimization of an aerosol can,"The main idea of solving a multicriteria optimization problem (MOP) is to find non-dominated solutions belonging to the Pareto frontier (e.g., a compromise between the criteria). If we consider our criteria as players, we can remark that the obtained solutions are the result of a cooperation of the players to increase their profits which is the same principle of solving a bargaining problem (BP). The Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS) model suggests an attractive solution for the BP called KS equilibria that can be also a MOP solution without having to calculate the Pareto Frontier known to be computationally so expensive. In this paper, we propose an algorithm aimed to rapidly finding the KS solution. The idea is to make a coupling between the KS algorithm and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) metamodel called KS-RBF. In fact, the KS algorithm transforms the MOP into a succession of single objective problems (SOP); for our proposed algorithm, the objective function of each SOP will be replaced by an approximate one using a reliable RBF metamodel (SOP-RBF). The performance of the proposed approach is firstly validated by some well-known mathematical multicriteria problems (Tanaka, Poloni, and ConstMIN problems) by finding a KS solution belonging to the Pareto Frontier; then, we used it to solve a realistic industrial case, namely, shape optimization of the bottom of an aerosol can undergoing non-linear elasto-plastic deformation in order to simultaneously minimize the dome growth (DG) (e.g., displacement of can base) at a proof pressure and maximize the dome reversal pressure (DRP), a critical pressure at which the aerosol can's bottom loses stability (e.g., initiates buckling). The KS solutions are compared with Pareto Frontier results previously suggested in other papers. The comparison leads us to confirm the performance of the KS-RBF coupling.",10.1007/s00158-019-02321-8
J,"Abasikeles-Turgut, I",The Effect of the Range of Cluster Head on the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks Under Various Sizes of Network and Number of Nodes,"The problem of energy efficiency due to the limited resources in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has made cluster-based architectures widespread use in these networks. The studies in literature regarding WSNs aim to make efficient use of battery in network by different methods such as using different parameters in cluster head selection, time-based cluster head election or clustering with artificial intelligence algorithms. The coverage area of clusters is selected in a range that can cover the whole network in some studies, while it is limited in others. In this study, the effect of the cluster-head coverage area parameter on the lifetime of the network is investigated with detailed simulations. The death of the first, middle, and last node are reported by using different numbers of nodes, coverage areas, and network sizes. According to the results obtained, the increase of the cluster coverage area causes the first node deaths to be delayed and the middle and last node deaths to occur earlier. The increase of the network area takes all the node measurements at an early cycle while the first node is at the highest level and the last node at the lowest level. As the number of nodes increases, the first node deaths are delayed to an earlier cycle, while the middle and final node deaths are delayed. In the light of the results obtained, it is thought that this study will help the cluster coverage area to be selected according to the design preferences in clustering based architectures that will be designed both in real time and in the simulation environment in future.",10.2339/politeknik.435581

The natural Gypseous soil with 66% gypsum used in the study was brought from Salah Al-Deen governorate in Iraq while that of the sand was brought from Karbalaa governorate, south of Baghdad, Iraq. The model pile used is smooth steel pipe pile with slenderness ratios (L/D) of 10, 15, 20 and 25. The effect of the gypsum content included in the soil as well as the effect of rest time and the effect of (L/D) on the pullout capacity of pile were studied in the laboratory scale model pile. The results showed that the pullout capacity of pile in Gypseous soil is more than its capacity in Sandy soil by about 64%. When the rest time was increased, the pullout capacity of tension pile embedded in Gypseous soil decreased. Increasing (L/D) ratio of pile in Gypseous soil from 15 to 20 increases pullout capacity of pile to about 65%, while increasing that ratio from 20 to 25 increases pullout capacity of pile to about 76%.",

J,"Ahumada-Lazo, JA; Shu, FJ; Chen, RH",Characterization of recirculating structures in the near field of underexpanded swirling jets,"Recirculation in underexpanded supersonic jet flow with varying degrees of swirl was experimentally investigated due to its potential for enhanced flame holding in supersonic combustion engines. Recirculation caused by swirl is free of solid walls, avoiding the challenge of wall cooling due to high heat fluxes. Schlieren imaging, planar laser Mie scattering, and planar particle image velocimetry were used to observe and quantify shock cell and vortex structure, and where applicable, to map velocity in and around the recirculation zone. Case study showed that different patterns of tangential injection, pressure ratios, and nozzle sizes were more or less favorable to flow recirculation. Various metrics of recirculation and shock structure were correlated with the onset, variability, characteristic length, and characteristic time of recirculation vortex. Statistical analysis of instantaneous velocities indicated that (1) recirculation velocity and recirculation zone width had standard deviations of similar to 30% and similar to 20%, respectively (in part due to unsteady precession of the vortex around the axis of mean flow); and (2) the average velocity within the recirculation zone was seen to be insensitive to the pressure ratio (and hence, to the fully expanded Mach number). The recirculation zone width was slightly increased by doubling the pressure ratio, within the range investigated. Thus, under conditions that most favored recirculation, the net effect of (1) and (2) was the formation of a toroidal vortex structure within which the average velocity was sufficiently slowed (by a factor of 3 relative to the bulk velocity) to measurably enhance flame holding in supersonic combustor applications.

Although anonymous authentications such as group signatures have been proposed, these schemes rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) capable of tracing misbehaving users. Thus, the privacy is not high, because the TTP of tracing authority can always trace users. Therefore, the anonymous credential system using a blacklist without the TTP of tracing authority has been proposed, where blacklisted anonymous users can be blocked. Recently, an RSA-based blacklistable anonymous credential system with efficiency improvement has been proposed. However, this system still has an efficiency problem: The data size in the authentication is O(K'), where K' is the maximum number of sessions in which the user can conduct. Furthermore, the O(K')-size data causes the user the computational cost of O(K') exponentiations. In this paper, a blacklistable anonymous credential system using a pairing-based accumulator is proposed. In the proposed system, the data size in the authentication is constant for parameters. Although the user's computational cost depends on parameters, the dependent cost is O(delta(BL) . K) multiplications, instead of exponentiations, where delta(BL) is the number of sessions added to the blacklist after the last authentication of the user, and K is the number of past sessions of the user.

J,"Al Amin, A; Abu Sied, A; Rabbani, KSE",A novel active AC coupled input stage of instrumentation amplifier for bioelectrical applications,"For recording bioelectrical signals using Instrumentation Amplifiers (INA), capacitive AC coupling of the differential inputs is necessary for two major reasons, providing DC electrical isolation of the subject to avoid hazards of tissue burn, and to block DC or very low frequency skin-electrode contact potentials. The latter, when met, allows high admissible differential gain of the INA, which in turn, is expected to give a desirable high Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR). However, the use of conventional passive RC high pass filters at the input greatly reduces CMRR. This work intends to design an improved AC coupled input circuitry for INA giving high CMRR and high input impedance. A differential RC high-pass input circuit has been developed using an active element. It creates an effective high resistance for the common mode current but provides a low resistance path to input bias currents for normal operation of the INA. Between 1 Hz and 100 Hz, CMRR of the DC coupled INA (LT1167) was 115 dB, using a well matched traditional RC coupling, 55 to 95 dB, while it was 110 dB using the improved active AC coupled circuit. This improvement was practically demonstrated through Electrocardiogram measurements from a human subject.

J,"Al-Naddaf, M; Tannoury, GA; Han, J; Parsons, RL; Zhang, C",Development of Laboratory Procedure for Evaluating Microcracking Technology on Cement-Modified Soil Subgrade,"Cement modification of soils has been widely practiced for the last few decades. Recently, cement has become a more economical binder to modify in situ subgrade soil because other binders, such as fly ash, have become less available and therefore their prices have gone up significantly. In addition, a much higher percentage of fly ash needs be used when compared with cement to achieve the same subgrade strength and stiffness. However, cement-modified subgrade may have an issue with shrinkage cracking, which can eventually reflect through the asphalt pavement layers to the surface after construction. For some subgrade soils, a high cement content is needed to meet the unconfined compressive strength requirement without jeopardizing durability. A higher cement content will result in higher shrinkage cracking potential. To overcome this problem, microcracking technology has been developed and adopted in the field. This technology involves recompaction of cement-modified soil (CMS) with a roller 24-48 h after initial compaction to induce microcracks in the CMS and minimize the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Microcracking of CMS is not expected to significantly reduce the strength and stiffness of CMS, but it is expected to increase its permeability and reduce the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Unfortunately, the procedure to simulate microcracking of CMS in the laboratory and evaluate its effect on properties of CMS has not been established yet.

As in the real-valued case, the maximum complex correntropy criterion (MCCC) employs a free parameter called kernel width, which affects the convergence rate, robustness, and steady-state performance of the method. However, determining the optimal value for such parameter is not always a trivial task. Within this context, several works have introduced adaptive kernel width algorithms to deal with this free parameter, but such solutions must be updated to manipulate complex-valued data. This work reviews and updates the most recent adaptive kernel width algorithms so that they become capable of dealing with complex-valued data using the complex correntropy. Besides that, a novel gradient-based solution is introduced to the Gaussian kernel and its respective convergence analysis. Simulations compare the performance of adaptive kernel width algorithms with different fixed kernel sizes in an impulsive noise environment.

An accurate mechanism for their occurrence requires resolution of multitude of issues. One aspect not considered to date is the drop in the lake's water level of about 15 m in the last 25 years. This study focuses on the role of this drop in the lake's water level. Satellite remote sensing and slope stability analysis methods are used. The results demonstrate significant influence of rapid drop in water level on the occurrence of cracks. The results are also significant for general understanding of the mechanism of occurrence of ground cracks elsewhere in the world.",10.1007/s10706-019-00931-z

The impregnation solution was prepared at 10 % and 20 % concentrations. Alfa-X, a flame-retardant chemical formerly applied to textiles and laminate parquet, was used for the first time in wood work. As a result of the combustion tests, Alfa-X reduced the initial weight loss temperature of the wood material in both samples. However, it has completely raised the combustion temperature gradients in both samples. It is observed that ending temperature increased in eastern beech wood and in scotch pine wood by 117 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively, with increasing the rate of Alfa-X added into impregnation solution from 0 % to 20 % at deterioration. In addition, the bending and compression strength values of the Scotch pine and Eastern beech wood samples were also examined.",10.2339/politeknik.481589

This paper focuses on path planning in the presence of soft tissue deformation based on bio-heat transfer. In order to perform path planning based on soft tissue deformation, modelling of temperature distribution is conducted by establishing a potential field (biological temperature field) method in the presence of soft tissue deformation to generate the optimal path to the target. A 3D governing equation is discretised based on finite element formulations to solve the temperature distribution. The finite element modelling applies the steady-state heat transfer with variable thermal conductivity.

J,"Balasubramaniam, AS; Oh, E; Chao, G; Kim, H; Hwang, RN","Instrumented Piles Tested in 1969 in Fine Loose Sand at Holmen, Drammen: Revisited 2019","The work presented here relates to the instrumented piles tested in 1969, by the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) in loose sand at Holmen, Drammen. The material contained in the first publication, which is an Internal Report F.273.0 of NGI (Balasubramaniam et al., 1969), was mainly on the load tests only and contained the analyses of the vibrating wire gauges as based on the zero of the gauges after the pile driving, to make sure the best set of zero values were used. The publication of Gregersen et al. in 1969, includes pull out tests and also the effect of the residual stresses developed in the piles during pile driving. Further, the work of Gregersen et al. contains a detail section on the performance of the vibrating wire gauges and in particular the drifting of the zero of the gauges. The entire pile testing work and reporting in NGI internal report F.273.0 (Balasubramaniam et al., 1969) included a description of the instrumentation used and the results obtained from load and pull out tests on precast reinforced concrete piles. The piles, of circular cross section and available in standard lengths, can be joined together in the field by means of threaded connectors. The primary purpose of the instrumentation was to determine the distribution of axial load along the length of the pile and the point load and also to measure the distribution of lateral earth pressure acting on the periphery of the pile. To accomplish these goals, the piles were equipped at a number of levels with strain gauges embedded in the concrete, on the reinforcing steel, and earth pressure cells on the sides of the piles, together with hydraulic piezometers for measuring pore water pressure in the sand. The instrumentation system was based on the operating principle of the vibrating-wire strain gauge (Bjerrum et al., 1965). Altogether four instrumented piles were used in the test program, three cylindrical and the fourth conical in shape, and had a uniform taper, typical for a Norwegian timber pile. The piles were constructed in such a manner that the 8m long cylindrical and conical piles can be tested first and later, after completion of these tests each one of them can be lengthened by connecting additional 8m segment of instrumented cylindrical pile to make up two 16 m long test piles. The test program also included additional tests on a single pile, which was made up of 4 m long precast concrete pile sections driven one section at a time and tested for embedded lengths of 3.5, 7.5, 11.5, 15.5, 19.5 and 23.5 m; the latter pile only had load cell at the top to measure the applied load and was not instrumented.",

J,"Barbieri, N; de Melo, RP; de Lima, KF; Barbieri, GDV",Dynamical analysis of B-train vehicle combination with liquid cargo,"In this work, a combination of B-train type vehicle is dynamically analysed through lateral movement at low speed manoeuvre known as Lane Change Manoeuvre. The analyses were conducted for a vehicle with liquid loads of 100%, 80%, 60% and 40% capacity. The analyses involve adjusting the steer angle through an objective function taking into account the numerical and experimental lateral acceleration of the tractor vehicle. The movement of the liquid (slosh) during the manoeuvres are approximated using the software Pasimodo and trammel pendulum. Considering the upper surface of the liquid inside the tank as a straight line, it is possible to obtain the centre of gravity variation and the moment of inertia through polynomial adjustments. In this way, it is possible to analyse numerically the behaviour of the vehicle with liquid load in a curved trajectory. To obtain modal parameters, the operational modal analysis technique is used. With the applied methodology, it was possible to find good agreement between the numerical and experimental values of the acceleration signals in four different positions in the vehicle combination. Through the analyses of the vehicle with fluid in movement, it was possible to verify a great variation of load in the wheels due to transfer of load of the vehicle travelling by curved trajectories or due to evasive manoeuvres. This is a critical condition that can lead the vehicle to rollover condition. The experimental data were obtained for the vehicle at constant speed (between 30 and 40 km/h) and under these conditions, the vehicle is considered stable by analysing the eigenvalues.",10.1177/0954407019838127

In order to define the optimum time for ballast bed cleaning or renewal as well as to improve ballast serviceability and track life cycle performance, better knowledge of the ballast bed condition, i.e. definition of the degree of ballast fouling is of crucial importance. As a core maintenance activity in ballasted track, the tamping process influences the economical service life of the track to a great extent and is essential in restoring the track geometry for safe train operations. During the tamping process, the tamping tines interact with the ballast matrix, transferring the displacement caused by the dynamic excitation overlapped with the extension in the hydraulic cylinder to the ballast, compacting it under the sleeper. This interaction is observed and measured in-situ in several locations in Austria. Serving as a mean of comparison and confirmation with the conducted in-situ measurements, a semi-analytical model of the tamping unit - ballast matrix interaction has been developed. Conclusions regarding the differences in response and resistance to compaction of both new and fouled ballast material are made and presented in this paper.",10.1002/gete.201900019
J,"Barka, E; Birle, E; Demond, D",Geotechnical investigations on modified steel slags,"Extensive experimental investigations have shown that the water permeability of steel slags can be reduced by the addition of fine-grained additives, such that they can be used as additional sealing layer, in accordance with the technical recommendations for the use of soils and building materials with environmentally relevant substances in earthworks (M TS E). The experimental investigations were carried out on three steel slags which were granulometrically modified using four fine-grained additives. The results of the water permeability tests show that the coefficient of permeability k(f) <= 1 . 10(-8) m/s can already be achieved with an addition of 8 wt.-% fine-grained additives. In comparison to natural soils, it should be noted that steel slags generally require a higher compaction energy (modified proctor energy) to achieve a low air void ratio with accompanying additional reduction of their water permeability and that the swelling capacity of sodium-activated bentonite can be reduced due to the high ion concentration in the pore solution.",10.1002/gete.201900011

To achieve parallel decoding, a well-established technique is to insert markers into the variable length code (VLC) stream. By locating markers, it is then possible to extract the sub-streams that are, in turn, decoded in parallel. The use of markers adversely affects compression especially when a high degree of parallelism is required. In this paper, we propose an architecture of a marker-free parallel decoding approach of VLC streams. Instead of multiple local entropy decoders, the proposed architecture is based on using a single parallel entropy decoder in conjunction with a novel format to construct the VLC stream. The approach runs at high clock rates supporting parallelism to a high number of decoders. A synthesized clock frequency well above 110 MHz is achieved for up to 20 decoders on a medium-sized FPGA.",10.1007/s11554-017-0715-2

Thus, decoration of copper in zinc oxide surface blocks some pore of zinc oxide and hence reduces surface area. XPS results reveal that copper was decorated in zinc oxide nanorods surface as metallic copper. The efficiency of Z and CuZ samples was inspected for the reduction of mercury ions under visible light.

The proposed method was validated against ionization chamber measurements. Beam attenuation through treatment couches (Varian Medical Systems) and immobilization devices (CIVCO Radiotherapy, USA) was examined. The dependency of beam attenuation on field size, photon energy, thickness of the couch, and the presence of a phantom were studied. Attenuation images were derived by computing the percentage difference between images obtained without and with a couch or immobilization devices determining the percentage of attenuation at the center and the mean attenuation. The beam attenuation measurements obtained with an a-Si EPID and an ionization chamber agreed to within +/- 0.10 to 1.80%. No difference was noted between the center and mean of an attenuated image for a small field size of 5 x 5 cm(2), whereas a large field size of 15 x 15 cm(2) exhibited differences of up to 1.13%. For an 18 MV beam, the a-Si EPID required additional build-up material for accurate assessment of beam attenuation. The a-Si EPID could measure differences in beam attenuation through an image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) couch regardless of the variabilities in couch thickness. Interestingly, the addition of a phantom reduced the magnitude of attenuation by approximately 1.20% for a field size of 15 x 15 cm(2). A simple method is proposed that provides the user with beam attenuation data in either 2D or 1D within a few minutes.",10.1007/s13246-019-00789-8

During the surgery the blood supply of the intestine may appear sufficient even though the microperfusion is not fully adequate. The degree of blood supply of remaining intestinal segment and the positioning of the resection margins is estimated subjectively by the surgeon's experience or objectively by means of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. The subject of our study is the evaluation of the infrared thermal imaging as another supportive non-invasive imaging method in assessment of intestinal blood supply, and to compare surgeon's decisions of the position of resection line with information obtained by infrared thermal imaging and by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. Methods: A pilot study on thermal imaging measurements was done in a porcine model. The infrared thermocamera Workswell WIC 640 was used in our study. The thermal imaging was correlated with the indocyanine green imaging method ICG NOVADAQ and with surgeon's subjective expert decisions of the places of resection lines. Fifteen monitored resections were performed on three experimental porcine models. Results: Based on the data evaluated, experience of the surgical team and the post-operative conditions of the porcine models, we conclude that the thermal imaging is a useful tool for determination of the optimal intestinal resection margins, and thus contributes to lowering anastomotic complications rate in colorectal surgery. The results show relatively high consistency between the used imaging techniques. Both methods showed ischemic regions of the intestine at a comparable level. The IRT methods showed even a slightly higher match with the surgeon's rating. Conclusion: Based on experiments, the infrared thermography can be considered as one of complementary imaging methods suitable for use during anastomosis surgery. The sensitivity and versatility of the infrared thermography method was demonstrated. There was confirmed agreement in obtained information about the position of area with maximal blood insufficiency obtained by IRT with the information obtained by using the ICG method. (C) 2019 AGBM.

J,"Britton, LG; McDavid, BC",Deflagration in empty tank being rinsed with water,"A deflagration occurred inside a 200-gal (0.757 m(3)) atmospheric mixing vessel during the course of apparently normal operations. The vessel had previously been used to dilute 70% aqueous tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) with deionized water. Ten minutes earlier the mixed batch had been transferred out and the vessel had been given a brief rinse with deionized water about 4 minutes after the transfer. The deflagration occurred soon after starting the second of two deionized water rinses. Although the hinged vessel lid was forced open and damaged there were no injuries or chemical exposures since no personnel were in the area at the time. The incident was caused by a faulty metering system that overcharged sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution to the deionized water supply. The roughly 100-fold overcharge of bleach resulted in a vigorous, gassy reaction with t-BHP in the mixing vessel. The reaction generated a gas-phase mixture comprising mostly acetone plus about 90% oxygen. The ignition energy of a replicated mixture was 0.015 mJ, similar to that of optimum hydrogen-air, but with poor upward mixing of acetone the ignition energy could have been as small as 2 mu J. The source of ignition could not be identified with certainty; the ""least improbable"" scenario was considered to be a spark from an electrically charged slug of rinse water falling through an electrically charged mist that had formed during the gassy reaction.

J,"Brodersen, M; Volmer, A; Schmidt, G",Signal enhancement for communication systems used by fire fighters,"So-called full-face masks are essential for fire fighters to ensure respiratory protection in smoke diving incidents. While such masks are absolutely necessary for protection purposes on one hand, they impair the voice communication of fire fighters drastically on the other hand. For this reason communication systems should be used to amplify the speech and, therefore, to improve the communication quality. This paper gives an overview of communication enhancement techniques for masks based on digital signal processing. The presented communication system picks up the speech signal by a microphone in the mask, enhance it, and play back the amplified signal by loudspeakers located on the outside of such masks. Since breathing noise is also picked up by the microphone, it's advantageous to recognize and suppress it - especially since breathing noise is very loud (usually much louder than the recorded voice). A voice activity detection distinguishes between side talkers, pause, breathing out, breathing in, and speech. It ensures that only speech components are played back. Due to the fact that the microphone is located close to the loudspeakers, the output signals are coupling back into the microphone and feedback may occur even at moderate gains. This can be reduced by feedback reduction (consisting of cancellation and suppression approaches). To enhance the functionality of the canceler a decorrelation stage can be applied to the enhanced signal before loudspeaker playback. As a consequence of all processing stages, the communication can be improved significantly, as the results of measurements of real-time mask systems show.",10.1186/s13636-019-0165-9

J,"Caniggia, S; Mardiguian, M",Simple Analytical Approximate Formulation for the Shielding Effectiveness of a Metallic Panel With Apertures,"The present paper is proposing a methodological approach for predicting the Shielding Effectiveness (SE) of metallic walls with various apertures, supported by software simulations. First, the SE modeling for a single aperture is addressed, whereas, at the difference with an homogeneous barrier, the transmission through a slot of given length behaves as a dipole that re-radiates some of the incident RF power. Because of this, the re-radiated field behind the barrier -hence the SE- becomes dependent of the barrier-to-target distance. Next, the SE for a single row of apertures is addressed, with an attempt for quantifying its dependency upon N identical holes and their individual separation. A further step is treating the SE for an array of NxM holes, including the effect of an off-axis shift target location. Some of the simulation results are compared with those obtained by using a few, widely-used simple formulae, trying to characterize their limitations, and proposing correction factors as the discrepancy typically increase with the barrier-to-target distance.",10.1109/LEMCPA.2020.2982881

However, there is still a lack of efficient approaches to automating the projection from the system design to the control software dimension. In this study, a model-driven approach is proposed to generate the control logic design based on the IEC 61499 Function Block from the system design in SysML. First, the system design model is formally defined to be unambiguously interpreted. Second, the SysML-FB profile is defined based on which control logic can be modelled in compliance with the IEC 61499 Function Block in the unified SysML modelling environment. Third, transformation rules between these two models are proposed, according to which a distributed event-driven control logic design can be automatically generated.

Four sections of a two-lane highway that have different shoulder widths were selected for the study. Under prevailing conditions, a two-lane highway with a shoulder width of fewer than 1.5 meters will cause a motorcycle to interfere with the carriageway and other impact factors that make capacity significantly less than HCM2010 calculation. The analysis of the base conditions model determined that the maximum capacity of a two-lane highway with a shoulder width of 2.0 meters was 1979 passenger car/hour/direction.

J,"Chen, F; Chen, DY; Wang, LL",The Micro-Miniature Capacitance Sensor Based on Light-Trigger Technology and Its Hardware Design in the Electrical Capacitance Tomography System,"Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) technology can monitor the multi-phase flow in closed pipes or vessels. The monitoring technology has the advantages of anti-intrusion, low manufacturing cost, high-temperature resistance, and simple structure. At present, ECT systems use small-scale sensors for signal capture, but such sensors have problems such as low sensitivity and poor anti-interference, which have attracted the attention of researchers. In this study, a light-trigger sensor was proposed, which was equipped with a special light window to receive optical signals. At the same time, in terms of the problem of electromagnetic shielding and optical window protection, a light window structure that transmitted optical signals and shields electromagnetic waves was designed. Based on the light-trigger sensor, the other modules of the ECT system were designed, considering that the sensor would be interfered by the measurement of stray capacitance, the intra-isoelectric driver cable shielding technology, the double T-type simulation switch matrix, and the digital-mode demodulation technology was introduced. Consequently, the performance of the sensor was tested. During the experiment, the sucrose flow pattern was used as the test object. The results showed that compared with the traditional sensors, the image distortion of the sensor based on the ECT system was lower; while in the performance test of the ECT system, the introduction of the double T-type simulation switch matrix, the digital-analogy demodulation technology, and the bipolar plate excitation mode could further optimize the signal-to-noise ratio index of the image; in the sensitivity test of the ECT system, the introduction of bipolar plate excitation mode could improve the output sensitivity of the capacitance.",10.1166/jno.2019.2709

J,"Chen, JSJ","2016 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Mechanical Engineering presented to Shu Chien, MD, Ph.D.","The dynamics in blood circulation is determined by the functional states of its components, i.e., cardiac contractility, vascular hindrance, and blood viscosity. While blood viscosity is a determinant of blood flow, the shear stress resulting from blood flow also modulates blood viscosity. This shear dependence of blood viscosity is a result of the composition of the blood as a suspension of deformable and aggregable blood cells in protein-containing plasma. The interplay between blood rheology and shear stress has significant implications on circulatory regulation in health and in cardiovascular and hematological diseases. Shear stress also acts on the vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to modulate their gene and protein expressions to regulate vascular function in health and diseases, particularly those resulting from atherosclerosis such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Understanding of the mechanisms of mechanotransduction and gene regulation underlying the shear-modulation of vascular function is essential for the improvement of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these fatal diseases. Shu Chien has elucidated the fundamental determinants of blood viscosity, viz. cell concentration, plasma viscosity, and shear-dependent cell aggregation and cell deformability, which is determined in turn by intracellular viscosity, cell geometry, and membrane properties. He has applied such fundamental mechanical and molecular knowledge to the understanding of the role of blood rheology in cardiovascular and hematological diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and sickle cell disease. His findings have led to improved management of these disorders such as the use of blood thinners to prevent restenosis after vascular stenting. By using a combination of cellular, molecular, and genomic techniques, coupled with innovative engineering experimentation and analysis, Dr. Chien has elucidated the roles of flow patterns in mechanotransduction and gene regulation in endothelial cells, including mechano-sensing, molecular signaling, genetic and epigenetic modulation, and functional regulation in response to mechanical forces. He formulated the concept that the adaptive response of intracellular rheology to different shear stress patterns is a key mechanism for homeostasis. He established the principle that shear stress with a clear direction is athero-protective, while that without is atherogenic; this has led to the recognition of the importance of minimizing disturbed flow in the treatment and prevention of a variety of clinical conditions.",10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.11.019

The errors of the interpolated dynamic discrete Fourier transform (IpD(2)FT) due to interharmonic interferences are investigated. Then the optimal frequencies where the IpD(2)FT has the smallest interharmonic interference are obtained. To achieve higher accuracy, the Taylor-Fourier multifrequency (TFM) model-based method is used to estimate and then eliminate the interharmonic component further. Concerning response time requirements, robust thresholds for transient detection are obtained based on numerous simulations, and the Kaiser-based IpD(2)FT is used to meet the corresponding limits.

The studies include ventilator rotation speeds and air extraction rates with and without ventilator's rotating, under different wind speeds and heights of the low-pressure ventilation device. Results show that the modified ventilators exhibit better air extraction rates than the conventional one does at all of the test wind speeds, especially at low wind speeds and as the ventilator not rotating.

J,"Chen, X; Chen, XR; Li, G",Practical Design Methods for Fire Resistance of Restrained Cellular Steel Beams,"Thermal responses of steel beams under fire can be intricate, considering the coupling effects between material thermal-expansion, mechanical property degradation, and constraints by surrounding structural members. While research efforts have focused on catenary action of structural members without initial imperfections, few accurate and efficient methods are found to reveal the fire resistance of restrained cellular steel beams (RCSBs). In this paper, parametric and regression analysis are applied to investigate the thermal behavior of RCSBs with initial imperfections. Eight groups of RCSBs are set up to demonstrate how various design parameters may affect structural responses at elevated temperatures. The results indicate that axial restraint stiffness ratio, load ratio, and opening diameter-to-height ratio significantly affect the structural responses of RCSBs in fire, followed by the rotational restraint stiffness ratio and span-to-depth ratio as secondary effects. Through the orthogonal and regression analysis, simplified formulas for four characteristic temperatures and four characteristic internal forces are defined, which agree with finite element results to a certain extent. Meanwhile, reasonable range of each design parameter is put forward for a more efficient and applicable calculation of thermo-mechanical responses of RCSBs.

J,"Davis, SG; Pagliaro, JL",Importance of properly designing dust explosion protection systems: Case study-2014 plywood manufacturing facility fire and explosion,"When designing handling and conveying equipment for combustible dusts, it is crucial to properly implement protective measures (e.g., deflagration venting, suppression, and isolation) capable of mitigating the potential consequences in the event the dust is ignited. Generally speaking, dust processing, storage, and collection equipment, such as cyclones, mills, baghouses, dryers, and silos are typically connected via pipes, pneumatic conveyors, and dust extraction or aspiration lines. If a fire or dust explosion occurs in one vessel, or the interconnecting piping, the flame front or pressure can quickly propagate through these conduits to other parts of the plant and potentially escalate to even worse consequences than the original event. Improper design of isolation devices can be costly, as illustrated by this case study on the fire and explosion in a baghouse that occurred on April 26, 2014 at a plywood manufacturing facility in Texas. More specifically, numerous deficiencies in the system design were identified, which included (1) required air stream flow rates; (2) proper isolation designs; (3) exclusion zones in the anticipated path of a vented deflagration; and (4) impeding deflagration vents. The root cause analysis identified that had a dust hazard analysis been properly performed, these deficiencies would have been identified and the explosion in the baghouse could have been avoided.

The well flow and electrical conductivity data of artesian wells identified in the study area were based on sampling performed from 2002 to 2003 and obtained from the Secretariat of Environment and Water Resources (SMARH). Spatialization of the Qt and EC in the area was performed using the geostatistical method of ordinary kriging (OK) and fitted using a spherical semivariogram. After spatial analyses, suitable crops for the area were identified according to the EC values, and a map of agricultural capability based on the artesian well Qt and EC was also produced.

The Ag-Z and Cu-Z exhibited bactericidal activity toward E. coli and A. baumannii after 3 and 6 h of exposure, respectively. The Zn-Z showed antibacterial activity toward both strains, but lacking the bactericidal effect even after 24 h of exposure. All studied samples released metal cations in seawater. Concentration of Ag and Zn leached from Ag-Z and Zn-Z was higher than maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) for drinking water, whereas concentration of Cu was below MAC. Due to high concentration of Na+ in seawater (about 1.2 g Na+ dm(-3)) an ion-exchange process can be responsible for the leaching of the studied cations. The lowest extent of leaching from Cu-Z was ascribed to different position and geometry of sites occupied by Cu(II) in the clinoptilolite lattice.
