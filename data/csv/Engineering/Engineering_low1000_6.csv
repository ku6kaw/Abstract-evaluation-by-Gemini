J,"Solomatin, VA; Balabanova, DA",Relief-Frequency Characteristics of Laser Scanners,"The concept of the relief-frequency characteristic of laser scanners is introduced. The necessity of using the relief-frequency characteristic is substantiated with a description of the frequency properties of laser scanners. A procedure for experimental determination of the relief-frequency characteristic of laser scanners has been developed, and studies were carried out. It is shown that the relief-frequency characteristic makes it possible to estimate most precisely the error of the laser scanner and to determine the range of reproduced spatial frequencies when scanning a relief. The proposed procedure can be used to describe the metrological characteristic of laser scanners.",10.1007/s11018-019-01681-3
J,"Soltani, Z; Asadi, S; Mehrshahi, E",Single transistor low phase noise active dielectric resonator oscillator,"In this paper, the design theory of an 8 GHz oscillator with a new structure of active dielectric resonator (DR) is presented. The new structure emphasizes on phase noise reduction by using only one active device. The proposed structure uses additional feedback from transistor to resonator in order to increase the quality factor. Measurement results report that phase noise is reduced to -145.19 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset frequency which represents 12 dB improvement compared with oscillators with passive DR. Also, in comparison with conventional active resonator oscillators, noise source of the second amplifier which makes spurious oscillation is removed. The size and power consumption are reduced due to the use of a single transistor. This structure has the lowest phase noise in comparison with other DR oscillators. In order to implement the proposed oscillator, a circuit including amplifier, resonator, coupler, and phase shifter is designed and realized.",10.1017/S1759078719000837
J,"Son, M; Adedokun, SI",Earth Pressure Envelope for Retaining Wall in Jointed Rock Ground,"Earth pressure against a retaining wall in a jointed rock ground are an important factor for design and construction. A physical model test, extensive numerical studies, and field observations were conducted and comprehensively analyzed. All of the results were integrated and analyzed to develop an earth pressure envelope for the design of retaining walls in a jointed rock ground. For this purpose, the rock mass conditions and induced earth pressures were systematically investigated for different analysis cases. The rock mass conditions were classified using the slope mass rating (SMR) method and divided into six rock mass classes. The induced earth pressures of cases in the same rock mass class were plotted together, and an earth pressure envelope that covers the induced earth pressures in each rock mass class was developed. The developed envelope was compared with field observations, which show that the field results are generally consistent with the developed envelope in the same rock mass class. The study results and developed earth pressure envelope could help to provide a better understanding and design of retaining walls in a jointed rock ground.",10.1007/s12205-019-2367-1
J,"Song, C; Kim, SE",Process and characterization of photo-definable organic-inorganic dielectric for wafer level packaging,"The introduction of an organic-inorganic dielectric material into the redistribution layers in fan-out wafer level packaging technology has been investigated to improve mechanical stress, thermal stability, and electrical breakdown compared to organic dielectric materials. A photo-definable organic-inorganic dielectric material called polysilsesquioxane (PSSQ) has been studied in this work. The photo-definable PSSQ dielectric allows a simultaneous UV patterning and curing process. A PSSQ sample was prepared by spin-coating on a 6-in. Si wafer, pre-baking at 100 degrees C for 5 min, UV exposure, and then PGMA developing. The cured PSSQ films have a dielectric constant from 2.0 to 2.38 and dielectric loss from 0.0001 to 0.005. In addition, the 2 mu m line patterns were obtained after 10 min of UV exposure.

J,"Song, E; Sim, HB",Effects of Modeling Parameters on Dynamic Performance of Railway PSC Bridge Girders,"This study investigated the effects of finite element modeling parameters on the dynamic characteristics and responses of railway prestressed concrete bridge girders. Free vibration analyses using different modeling parameters showed that the natural frequencies increased when an anchorage was included or when the upper flange thickness was kept constant in the modeling. The maximum dynamic responses of the girder at different speeds of two trains [a high-speed train (KTX) and a freight train] were compared using different modeling parameters. Changes in the flange thickness did not have any significant effect on the maximum vertical displacement. However, the maximum acceleration of the girder for the flange modeled with the originally designed varying thickness was higher than that for the flange modeled with the average thickness as a constant. This difference became more significant as the train speed approached the critical speed of resonance. Regardless of whether the anchorage was modeled, no significant change was found in the maximum vertical displacement for both KTX and the freight train. The vertical accelerations for both the trains were generally lower when the anchorage was modeled. Particularly, the vertical acceleration for KTX near its critical speed of resonance showed larger differences among the finite element models.",10.1007/s13296-019-00243-1
J,"Spalek, D",Generalization of Maxwell Stress Tensor Method for Magnetically Anisotropic Regions,"This article comments on the Maxwell stress tensor method for force calculation in magnetically anisotropic regions. Force acting on the magnetically isotropic region can be always represented by means of Maxwell stress tensor surface integral. However, the magnetic anisotropy causes the asymmetry of Maxwell stress tensor. Subsequently, the force cannot be always evaluated by the surface integral of the Maxwell stress tensor, only. This article points out that the surface integral has to be often supplemented by the volume integral of a defined residual vector. The residual vector does not vanish in the case of anisotropy and has to be incorporated into the Maxwell stress tensor method. Appropriate examples of force evaluations for anisotropic ball levitating in the electromagnetic field are presented. The total force value is four times checked by Maxwell stress tensor modified method (for cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems), sum of physical components (Lorentz and material forces), and coenergy method, subsequently.",10.1109/tmag.2019.2937283
J,"Springer, S; Schmidt, C; Schmalfuss, F","Information needs of users of conventional, connected and automated, connected vehicles in urban mixed traffic","Congestion prevention, safety benefits, environmental release-all these objectives are supposed to be accomplished as part of traffic networking and the increasing vehicle automation. As a result, drivers will move in an urban mixed traffic that consists of conventionally, (un)connected as well as automated, connected vehicles in the future. Innovative networking technologies will not only enable cooperative behavior that exceeds traditional interaction patterns, but also issue new challenges (e.g. approaching a signaled intersection untypically and decelerating) to humans by incorporating new vehicles into road traffic. Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) have the potential to optimize interactions between differently equipped road users, as long as they support the drivers by providing them with currently relevant information, but do not distract them at the same time. The informational needs drivers have in urban mixed traffic using conventionally, connected as well as automated, connected vehicles has rarely been examined so far. Therefore, the present paper examines this issue. Within the context of two research associations (""HarmonizeDD"" and ""SYNCAR""), three focus group discussions were conducted with five resp. six participants each. The constellation of the groups varied concerning the participant's experience towards automated vehicle functions (low vs. test driver). After presenting diverse urban scenarios using video animations, informational needs for these scenarios were collected and their importance was rated. The results show that especially during the initial phase of system usage as well as in situations, in which unusual and unnatural behaviors are shown or demanded, detailed information is desirable (e.g. indicating the trigger of a certain behavior-ambulance). Moreover, HMIs should be designed adaptively based on the passenger's/driver's varying experience and concomitantly the varying amount of required information. The present study's level of innovation is high, as to date, information presentation in specific driving scenarios based on networking technologies has only been examined for extra urban areas. Here, we address the resulting need for research in the field of urban mixed traffic with heterogeneously equipped road users explicitly.",10.1007/s10010-019-00328-7
J,"Sridharan, H; Ramalingam, S",DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TWO-PHASE INTERLEAVED VOLTAGE SOURCE INVERTER FOR PV APPLICATIONS,"The design of a voltage source inverter is challenging for PV-grid connected systems due to power quality issues. To improve the power quality,a two-phase interleaved voltage source inverter (IVSI) is proposed in this paper. IVSI phase shifts two voltage source inerters connected in parallel. The inverter topology is interfaced with a 40W PV panel employing a multiple maxima search (MMS) MPPT algorithm. This algorithm results in higher tracking efficiency compared to existing methods. Modelling of the PV with MPPT and the circuit configuration of the interleaved inverter is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The switches in the IVSI is controlled by employing a unipolar PWM technique. The performance of the IVSI is investigated in terms of weighted total harmonic distortion (WTHD), distortion factor (DF), harmonic spread factor (HSF), and inductor current ripple and compared with classical VSI. From the analysis, it is inferred that the proposed inverter results in reduced total harmonic distortion(THD) and decreased inductor current ripple thereby producing a high-quality output. The hardware model of the two-phase IVSI is developed and interfaced with PV where gating pulses are generated in FPGA. The simulation results are validated experimentally.",10.31436/iiumej.v20i2.1142

J,"Staub, J; Oberdorfer, D; Deutsch, W; Gandorfer, A; Grauf, B; Hirzberger, J; Mueller, MF; Woch, J",Development and qualification of the Feed-Select Mechanism for the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on-board Solar Orbiter,"The Solar Orbiter Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) will provide maps of the magnetic vector and of the line-of-sight velocities in the solar photosphere. For reaching its science goals, SO/PHI is equipped with two telescopes: the high resolution channel (HRT) and the full disk channel (FDT). Since both optical channels are fed into a common path including the camera, the need arises for a highly precise mechanism, which selects only one telescope at a time: the Feed-Select Mechanism (FSM). The mechanism therefore needs to serve two purposes: (1) directing one channel towards the camera, (2) shutting the second channel to not disturb the measurement of the observing channel. In this paper we will describe the different design features, as well as the design verification and qualification of the mechanism.",10.1007/s12567-019-00246-y
J,"Su, CC; Hung, CC",A ripple-based adaptive on-time controlled buck converter with slope balance technique,"A ripple-based adaptive on-time controlled buck converter with slope balance technique is presented in this paper. The slope balance technique provides a fixed switching frequency. A 4-bit single-slope analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used to fix switching frequency when power supply was from 3.3 to 4.5 V. The slope balance technique is proposed to achieve an adaptive on-time control and without extra clock-controlled circuits and current sensing circuits. The input voltage can be predicted from the adaptive on-time by using 4-bit single-slope ADC control. Measurement results show that switching frequency is 1.448 and 1.438 MHz when load current is 200 and 1000 mA, respectively. The proposed buck converter was fabricated in 0.35 mu m CMOS technology with a supply voltage of 4.5 V. The output voltage was measured to be 1.2 V and the load current range was determined to range 200-1000 mA.",10.1007/s10470-019-01471-5
J,"Su, XM; Zhang, R; Zhuo, ZC",All-optical temporal differentiation in hot standing-wave-dressed atoms,"We propose a scheme to realize all-optical temporal differentiation calculation to input pulse in an inverse Y-type four-level atomic system driven by a strong standing-wave. Two optical blockades are created at individual wavelengths of two probe fields in presence of one single strong standing-wave field. On one hand, ultra-narrow transmission windows are produced for probe pulse field 1 when probe field 2 is so strong as a controlling field in EIT configuration. The system can be designed as a phase-reverter of weak probe field 1 and can perform temporal differentiation calculation to it because a pi phase shift is created. On the other hand, the blockade at probe field 2 can be burst in two-photon resonance configuration when probe field 1 becomes strong and saturated absorption takes effect. So a two-photon switching is also expected in this standing-wave-dressed atomic system. The scheme has a potential for an all-optical transistor in quantum logical circuits.",10.1007/s11082-019-2066-7
J,"Sugiura, R; Kamamoto, Y; Moriya, T",Shape Control of Discrete Generalized Gaussian Distributions for Frequency-Domain Audio Coding,"Entropy coding, which is an essential part of audio compression, is always required to manage the tradeoffs between compression efficiency and computational complexity, and the strategy to achieve them highly depends on the distributions of inputs. In this paper, we present a method of controlling them for enhancing the compression efficiency of Golomb-Rice (GR) encoding, one of the simplest entropy coding methods optimal for Laplacian distributions. We will show that the proposed invertible and low-complexity mapping of integers enables the GR encoding to assign nearly the optimal code length for a wider range of distributions, generalized Gaussian distributions, maintaining low computational cost. A simulation by random numbers reveals that the proposed coder based on this scheme works about 6 times faster than the state-of-the-art arithmetic coder for Gaussian-distributed integers maintaining the increase in relative redundancy around, which is much lower than that of a conventional GR coder. Additionally, an application to a practical speech and audio coding scheme is presented, and an objective evaluation for real speech and audio signals confirms the advantages of the proposed method in compression. The method is expected to widen the capability of low-complexity entropy coding, providing us with more flexible codec designs.",10.1109/TASLP.2019.2945843
J,"Suikkanen, E; Juntti, M",Performance and ASIC Designs of the <i>K</i>-best LSD and LMMSE Detectors for LTE Downlink,"We consider performance comparison and application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs of linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) and K-best list sphere detector (LSD) algorithms for 4 x 4 and 8 x 8 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Requirements for higher data rate and lower power consumption set new challenges for implementation. In order to minimize the power consumption, an optimal detector would be able to switch the detection algorithm to suit the channel conditions. The detectors are designed for three different modulation schemes using 28 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The communications performance is evaluated in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system. The impact of transmit precoding is considered. The ASIC designs aim at providing the hardware design aspects to the comparison of detectors. The designs are synthesized and complexity and power consumption results are found.

J,"Sun, CN; Yeh, YL",On the Experimental and Application Study of High-Curvature Wing for Load-Task UAV,"Present work studies the aerodynamic properties of high curvature wing for UAV using wind tunnel test and CFD simulation. The high curvature S1210 wing is adopted for experiment and simulation. The lift condition with different AoA, the ground effect and wind speed effect are key topics to be examined and discussed in detail. The real flight test also be carried out in this work to verify the experiment and simulation results. Experimental results indicate that the high curvature wing not only has high AoA flight performance but also possesses ground effect when flies near ground. The ground effect is dependent on wing span and happens at distance lower than 1/4 span from the ground. Moreover, the flow over the wing surface does not separate till 18 degrees AoA. It illustrates that the high curvature S1210 wing is a good choice for task UAV.

J,"Sun, R; Zhong, DM; Li, WG",Formal system interactive failure analysis method based on systems theoretic process analysis model,"Interactive failures are failures caused by two or more components that often occur in complex systems when the system is modified, upgraded, or simply designed inadequately. However, the official guideline provided, namely, common cause analysis, cannot discover these problems. It cannot establish a complex interactive system model, nor can it provide a unified analysis method for all parts of the system. Another method, systems theoretic process analysis, is limited to the control system. To solve this problem, a method called system theoretic formal analysis method (STFAM) is proposed in this paper. STFAM establishes a system-component-interactive model that provides an abundance of interactive information for failure analysis and presents a unified model to support the analysis of multiple components in the system. It is divided into three steps. First, a hierarchical system structure is built and then transformed into a formalized state machine. Next, the interactive failures are determined and converted into a linear temporal logic or computation tree logic model. Finally, NuSMV is used to verify the model and record the results. To evaluate the proposed method, a practical problem that occurred in full-authority digital engine control, in which in some cases, the valve closes for unknown reasons until the system is reset is presented. An analysis of the issue demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.",10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.08.007

Many choices influence students to become IT-entrepreneurs. Association Rule can be used to obtain a model by analysing data so that it can be used to make a rule to the IT entrepreneurship-student model, but the association algorithm has disadvantages in handling large datasets. We propose reducing candidate itemsets using degrees of fuzzy similarity. The membership function in fuzzy sets can be used to measure the quality of rules obtained. The purpose of this study is to improve the algorithm by evaluating the similarity of candidate itemsets to get a good quality rule.

The samples were subjected to quasi-static pushover loading until the drift of 10% was reached. Then, based upon verified Finite Element models, the effect of axial loading on the seismic parameter of the frames including effective stiffness, ultimate strength, ductility, strength reduction factor, and energy dissipation capacity was evaluated. The results showed that UNP stiffeners exert a significant influence on the seismic behavior of moment resisting frames with steel shear walls and therefore they are recommended to be used in regions with high seismic risk.",10.1007/s13296-019-00245-z

J,"Tan, J",Design and Simulation of Cloud Computing Intelligent Routing Algorithms Based on Optical Network,"In the current communication technology, optical technology has been applied to the network to obtain optical network technology. Among them, optical network technology is optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which can play a larger transmission capacity under lower energy consumption. Further breakthroughs in intelligent optical networks require improvements in routing issues. In this study, firstly, the optical network architecture is analyzed, including wavelength division multiplexing optical network and elastic optical network. Then, the routing problem in optical networks is analyzed, and the main factors affecting the routing problem are extracted. On the basis of studying the energy consumption characteristics of data centers and WDM optical networks, and considering the characteristics of cloud service configuration, evolutionary game theory and optical bypass theory are introduced to obtain an intelligent routing algorithm for cloud computing based on optical networks, and energy consumption tests are carried out on data transmission and processing. In order to reduce the overall energy consumption, the use of IP routers is reduced, and the idle data servers are shut down. Then, it is found that the total energy consumption increases slowly at different times. The energy consumption of evolutionary game theory is compared. Compared with non-evolutionary game theory, the optimized intelligent routing algorithm makes the energy consumption more stable, while reducing the use of servers can further reduce the good expenditure.

J,"Tashiro, K; Kurosaki, M; Ochi, H",Precoder and Postcoder Design for Wireless Video Streaming with Overloaded Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems,"Mobile video traffic is expected to increase explosively because of the proliferating number of Wi-Fi terminals. An overloaded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique allows the receiver to implement smaller number of antennas than the transmitter in exchange for degradation in video quality and a large amount of computational complexity for postcoding at the receiver side. This paper proposes a novel linear precoder for high-quality video streaming in overloaded multiuser MIMO systems, which protects visually significant portions of a video stream. A low complexity postcoder is also proposed, which detects some of data symbols by linear detection and the others by a prevoting vector cancellation (PVC) approach. It is shown from simulation results that the combination use of the proposed precoder and postcoder achieves higher-quality video streaming to multiple users in a wider range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than a conventional unequal error protection scheme. The proposed precoder attains 40 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio even in poor channel conditions such as the SNR of 12 dB. In addition, due to the stepwise acquisition of data symbols by means of linear detection and PVC, the proposed postcoder reduces the number of complex additions by 76% and that of multiplications by 64% compared to the conventional PVC.",10.1587/transfun.E102.A.1825

J,"Tekkalmaz, M; Haydarlar, G; Ümit, ER",Investigation of the R260 Rail Steel Behavior at Varying Temperatures by EMI Method,"In recent years, Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) method has been widely used in structural health monitoring (SHM). In this method, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic sensor patch is added to the structure to be monitored for structural health.

The thin layer is formed by first synthesizing graphite soot from a butane flame before being turned into a liquid solution and drop-casted onto the substrate to form a thin graphene-like graphite film.

We studied the effects of temperature, rate of recirculation and the concentration of amine poor depending on the efficiency of absorption of CO2 and H2S. Satisfactory results were obtained when increases the flow and the concentration of amine poor, the absorption of CO2 and H2S also increase. With an improvement of the temperature of the amine of entry into the absorber, CO2 and H2S penetrate the upper stages of the absorbent and reduce the absorption of acid gases in the absorber. The concentration of CO2 in the clean gas can be greatly influenced by the number of stages, while for the concentration of H2S in the gas clean; the amount of stages plays a minor role. The software ASPEN PLUS represents a good tool for the calculation and the sensitivity analysis of the variables of operation of the process.",

In this study, TiO2 nanotube (TiNT) was grown on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V plates by means of anodization in an electrolyte solution containing glycerol, water and 0.5 wt.% of NH4 F. Silver particles were deposited on TiNT using a Photo-Assisted Deposition (PAD) method. Formation of crystalline phase of TiO2 on the surface was confirmed by means of XRD while its superficial morphology was observed using FESEM/EDS. Hydrophilicity was assessed by means of contact angle measurement. As-synthesized silver-loaded TiNT on osteoblast ATCC growth in vitro was also investigated in terms of its capacity in supporting osseointegration. The cell viability was determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5dipheny1-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay and its differentiation activity was measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay. The results showed that desposition of silver on TiNT increased cell viability after 14 days culture while improving the hydrophilicity feature. Silver-loaded TiNT on Ti-6Al-4V alloy with Ag precursor concentration of 0.10 M showed the optimum viability of osteoblast growth, with 14% improvement in comparison to its unmodified counterpart.

Substantial variations of pressure that are comparable with large meteorological variations are experimentally observed upon flowing a direct current pulse with a small amplitude and alternating currents of an industrial frequency through the conductor. Such significant and fast variations of the pressure occur at the instant the current in the conductor changes. Even current pulses with a short duration influence the pressure distinctly. Jumps of the pressure are experimentally observed in an investigated volume upon both building up the current amplitude and switching off the current pulse. These jumps are not typical for a usual cooling or heating of air mixture. It is expected that an exact correspondence between current pulses and the pressure variations makes it possible to create new technical equipment.

In character recognition, the aim is to identify the various texts, letters and symbols in the images as accurately and quickly as possible. In addition to the Optical Character Recognition (OCT) method, which is used as a very common method, there are many feature extraction methods in which character image features are compared. In this study, which is presented as another feature extraction method, the letters on the license plates are recognized. The characters were examined using the circular shape histogram technique and histograms were obtained from the sectors within the circular regions. Feature vectors for letter characters were created using character pixel densities in sectors. Feature vectors are analyzed linearly and an alternative quick character recognition method is presented. With the proposed method, the element numbers of the feature vectors are kept constant.

The method exploits the synergy of different mature technologies, and leverages the commercial availability of large, high-quality sheets of glass, with thickness up to few millimeters. The first step of the method foresees the pre-shaping of flat substrates of glass by replicating the accurate shape of a mold via direct hot slumping technology. The replication concept is advantageous for making large optics composed of many identical or similar segments. After the hot slumping, the shape error residual on the optical surface is addressed by applying a deterministic sub-aperture technology as computer-controlled bonnet polishing and/or ion beam figuring.

The molar ratios of La/Al were varied from 0.01 to 0.15. Based on temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, La addition apparently resulted in increased basicity of the catalysts, which is related to increasing of oxygen mobility. However, when considered the Pt dispersion measured by CO chemisorption, it was found that Pt dispersion also increased with increasing the amount of La addition up to La/Al = 0.05. It is suggested that too high amount of La addition can inhibit the dispersion Pt due to surface coverage of La. It is worth noting that the catalytic activity toward CO oxidation essentially depends on both Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility and they can be superimposed on each other. Based on this study, the Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst with La addition of La/Al molar ratio = 0.05 showed the highest activity due to its optimal Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility leading to its highest value of turnover frequency (TOF).

J,"Wang, CH; Li, SB",Abrasiveness evaluation of rock-cone bit based on fractured cuttings,"This paper looks at the influence of the sorting coefficient, average particle size and quartz content on the abrasion rate of the cone bit. This paper uses rock drillability experiments, particle sizing tests and XRD mineral component analyses as methodology. The results show that the larger the average particle size and sorting coefficient, the smaller the real contact area between the bit and the rock surface, the smaller the friction force. Meanwhile, the volume of the fractured cuttings increased. The results also show that the less the quartz content, the less hard points in the rock. All these factors lead to the reduction in drill bit damage. Because of the strong correlation among the factors of abrasiveness, this paper develops a model of the drill bit abrasion using the partial least square method. The main factors of the model are the grain size distribution and the quartz content of the rock. This model can also be used in the selection of drill bit type and the classification of rock abrasion.",10.1007/s13202-019-0654-5

Differentiation order is tuned by programming the temporal weighting mask (TWM) as power function of different exponents, not limited by the structure of the system. Assembly of the system is feasible, since the active parts are implemented by electro-optic elements and some key elements are reused between sub-systems involved in the scheme. Tuning of the system is simple, since electronically pre-stored TWMs are easy to switch among each other. The order-tunable functionality is verified by numerically testing the differentiation cases of normalized input pulse duration ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, and of differentiation order tuned from 1 to 10. Good accuracy is achieved, and measured by root mean square error lower than 0.1. Feasibilities of the system are also verified in terms of accuracy maintaining and distortion avoiding. Compared with existing methods, apart from the arbitrary order-tunable capacity and good accuracy, our proposed optical differentiator also possesses properties of good compactness and constant complexity.

Idle user equipments (UE) are used to cooperatively transmit jamming signal to confuse eavesdroppers (Eve). We propose a threshold-based jammer selection scheme to decide which idle UE should participate in the transmission of jamming signal. Threshold conditions are carefully designed to decrease interference to legitimate channel, while maintain the interference to the Eves. Moreover, fewer UE are activated, which is helpful for saving energy consumptions of cooperative UEs. Analytical expressions of the connection and secrecy performances are derived, which are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Theoretical and simulation results reveal that our proposed scheme can improve connection performance, while approaches the secrecy performance of [12]. Furthermore, only 43% idle UEs of [12] are used for cooperative jamming, which helps to decrease energy consumption of network.",10.1587/transfun.E102.A.2008

The rate of heat evolution, compressive strength, connected pore structure, and chloride binding capacity were investigated. The results show that CNA can accelerate cement hydration at early age, and therefore improve the 1-day strength of blended mixtures. The strength at 28 and 56 days can be maximized with 1% by weight CNA addition, but considerably reduced with 5% by weight CNA. Different from the mechanical properties, the connected pore structure and chloride binding capacity are improved straightforwardly with CNA addition, which benefits the ability to resist chloride attack. The experimental and modeling results demonstrate that CNA addition benefits the generation of carboaluminate, which has high efficiency to fill voids due to its higher volume, thus densifying the microstructure as well as improving the chloride resistance. However, these aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent (AFm) phases demonstrate little cementing capacity relative to calcium silicate hydrate (C S H) gels, thus resulting in an obvious decrease of strength with a high amount of CNA addition even though the microstructure is further densified.",10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002964

Results indicate that the pressure signal for conical housings exhibits longer rise time and more pronounced oscillations compared to that for blunt housings.

Written or historical records are rarely long enough to demonstrate patterns of occurrence, hence it is necessary to rely on geological records, many of which are subtle, incomplete, and subject to multiple possible interpretations. Brian Atwater has applied his expertise in coastal geology to the problem of reconstructing the history of earthquake-induced ""coastal submergence events"" caused by tsunamis or sudden sinking of the land surface. Events such as these have been directly observed in some cases, such as major earthquakes in Alaska and Chile in the 1960s, but longer histories must be reconstructed from the geological record. Using detailed observations of layers of different types of sediment in coastal marshes of Washington, Dr. Atwater and those who followed have shown that major submergence events have occurred roughly every 300 to 500 years along the coastal region known as Cascadia, stretching from British Columbia to Northern California. His studies have been replicated in numerous coastal regions worldwide where comparable hazards exist, helping emergency planners in these areas to better understand the magnitude of the potential risks.",10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.11.017

It is worth noting that the input-decimation approach is presented to decrease the number of input sequences for the recursive filter so that the computation cycle of RDFT/RIDFT can be shortened to meet the computing time requirement ( $3.6{\mu }s$ ) for the high-speed broadband communication systems. Therefore, the input-decimation RDFT/RIDFT algorithm is able to carry out at least 55.5 reduction of the total computation cycles compared with the considered algorithms. Furthermore, holding the advantages of input-decimation technique, the computational complexities of the real-multiplication and -addition are reduced to 41.3 and 22.2, respectively. The area and the power consumption can be minimized by employing the cost-efficient constant multiplier with the refined signed-digit expression of twiddle factors.

However, the application of damage identification method is still limited for complex spatial structures. In this paper, a practical residual force decomposition (RFD) method is proposed to identify damaged members in existing reticulated shell structures. A parameterized model is built by taking the stiffness reduction into consideration. In the proposed RFD method, the significant damage can be recognized corresponding to the changes of the observed eigenvector of the reticulated shells, and the eigenvector changes can be easily transferred to a set of multivariate linear equations to locate the members with significant stiffness reduction. The inputs of the equations are discussed including the additional constraints and the selection of effective modes. According to the different proportion of the numbers of members and joints, three situations of the solution are discussed. Especially when the solution is not unique, the importance coefficients of structural members are introduced as additional constraints through Ritz vector sensitivity analysis and application of the Modal Assurance Criterion. Two illustrative examples including a single-layer Kiewitt-6 reticulated shell and a structural model of international convention center are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

In this paper, the tracking supervision research of the 15Cr1Mo1V steel pipeline (three elbows with the most serious inclusions at different service time) is carried out in order to find out the variation and distribution law of the material's strength, toughness, metallographic structure and creep rupture strength. And on this basis, a creep fatigue life assessment is performed. The results show that the tensile strength, impact absorption energy and creep rupture property of the material decreased with the increase of the service time. The ductile-brittle transition temperature increased as time prolonging, all above room temperature, which means that the material is brittle. The main inclusions are MnS and SiO2 which are usually plastic, and the most serious inclusions are grade 3. Longitudinal inclusions are mostly of long-chain features, but no crack was found at the inclusion tips; the transverse inclusions are granular. The creep fatigue crack evaluation for the defects of plastic inclusions such as MnS and SiO2 shows that the crack propagation length at the inclusion tip after over 10(5) h of service is tiny which is consistent with the microscopic result, which means that the influence of the plastic inclusion on the structural integrity can be neglected. With the increase of the service time, the endurance strength gradually and slowly decreased. The presence of the inclusions did not accelerate the decline rate of the endurance strength, but might have an impact on the initial endurance strength of the new material. Meanwhile, brittle inclusion defects tend to generate stress concentration and induce the formation of cracks, so it is also necessary to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the inclusions and judge the inclusion category in the subsequent operation.",10.1016/j.ijpvp.2019.04.004
J,"Xu, HJ; Shiomi, J; Ishihara, T; Onodera, H",On-Chip Cache Architecture Exploiting Hybrid Memory Structures for Near-Threshold Computing,"This paper focuses on power-area trade-off axis to memory systems. Compared with the power-performance-area trade-off application on the traditional high performance cache, this paper focuses on the edge processing environment which is becoming more and more important in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. A new power-oriented trade-off is proposed for on-chip cache architecture. As a case study, this paper exploits a good energy efficiency of Standard-Cell Memory (SCM) operating in a near-threshold voltage region and a good area efficiency of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). A hybrid 2-level on-chip cache structure is first introduced as a replacement of 6T-SRAM cache as L0 cache to save the energy consumption. This paper proposes a method for finding the best capacity combination for SCM and SRAM, which minimizes the energy consumption of the hybrid cache under a specific cache area constraint. The simulation result using a 65-nm process technology shows that up to 80% energy consumption is reduced without increasing the die area by replacing the conventional SRAM instruction cache with the hybrid 2-level cache. The result shows that energy consumption can be reduced if the area constraint for the proposed hybrid cache system is less than the area which is equivalent to a 8 kB SRAM. If the target operating frequency is less than 100 MHz, energy reduction can be achieved, which implies that the proposed cache system is suitable for low-power systems where a moderate processing speed is required.",10.1587/transfun.E102.A.1741
J,"Xu, YX; Chang, SQ; Liu, L; Wang, TB; Hu, MY",Modeling Analysis on Improving Cylinder Balance in A Gasoline Engine Using Electromagnetic Valve Train,"For the multi-cylinder gasoline engine, the consistency among cylinders is an important index to affect the engine emission and the engine power. In this paper, an individual cylinder air-fuel ratio (A/F) control method for a fourcylinder camless engine with the electromagnetic valve train (EMVT) was proposed to reduce the imbalance of engine torque. An individual cylinder A/F estimation algorithm with a single universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor based on fading Kalman filtering was introduced. Four proportional-integral feedback controllers were built to regulate the individual A/F by adjusting the intake valve closing (IVC) timing of each cylinder independently based on the EMVT. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation and control approach was validated by co-simulation of GT-Power and Simulink. The results showed that the proposed estimation method could accurately estimate the individual cylinder A/F, and the maximum estimation error under steady state condition was less than 1 %. With the feedback control, both the individual A/F imbalance and the cylinderto- cylinder torque generation imbalance were decreased.",10.1007/s12239-019-0112-x

J,"Yamashita, Y; Fuji, M",Development of the fumed TiO<sub>2</sub> having high content of rutile structure and dispesibility using the dry-type of surface modification and the thermal treatment,"The effect of dry-type surface modification of a fumed TiO2 and the thermal treatment were studied to synthesize the new fumed TiO2 having a high content of rutile structure and high dispersibility. The fumed TiO2 was modified with various metallic alkoxides to prepare precursors and next the resulted precursors were thermally-treated by the novel natural dropping method with a very short heating time, less than 1 s. The focus of this investigation was on the metallic alkoxide species as a surface modification agent and morphologies of both the precursor and thermally-treated fumed TiO2. The morphologies and nanostructures of the obtained fumed TiO2 were characterized. The carbon content and agglomerate of the precursor influenced on the transformation ratio from anatase to rutile structure. It was confirmed that the dry-type surface modification with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and titanium tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP) at room temperature is very effective method to prepare precursors for the next thermal treatment. The thermally-treated fumed TiO2 modified with TTIP showed 100% rutile structure with pure TiO2 composition at 1400 degrees C. The thermally-treated fumed TiO2 modified with small quantities of TEOS exhibited both 100% rutile structure and excellent dispersibility. This high dispersibility caused from a sponge-like structural characteristic of the agglomerate and static electricity repellence by coated SiO2 layer. The thermally-treated fumed TiO2 modified with TEOS and TTIP showed the color tone shift can be attributed to rutile structure. It was revealed that the combination of dry-type surface modification and natural dropping thermal treatment is an attractive method to prepare the new fumed TiO2 with 100% rutile structure maintaining the high dispersiblity.

J,"Yang, CD; Lu, TH; Chen, WJ",Magnetoreception-based Navigation Mechanism of Black-faced Spoonbill,"Studying the birds' natural ability of long-range migration hopefully improves the existing navigation technology. The ability of navigation using the geomagnetic field is known as magnetoreception. Recently, a theory based on quantum mechanics reports that the geomagnetic field can affect some molecular chemical reactions of birds and thereby change their flight directions. This chemical magnetoreception process is called radical pair (RP) mechanism. This paper uses quantum spin theory to analyze the magnetoreception effect caused by the reaction of free radical pairs to the geomagnetic field. A quantum spin model is established here to simulate the bird's visual magnetic compass as a navigation tool to sense their orientations with respect to the geomagnetic field. The established visual magnetic compass is then applied to verify the magnetoreception of Platalea minor, commonly known as black-faced spoonbill. By tracking the GPS signals of an individual Platalea minor, the actual migration path is successfully incorporated into the mathematical model to reconstruct the visual images of the geomagnetism on the retina of Platalea minor and to expound its magnetoreception navigation ability along the migratory route from Taijiang National Park in Taiwan to the border area between North and South Korea.",10.6125/JoAAA.201912_51(4).08

In this paper, a novel multiplier-free maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detection scheme is proposed and verified in dual-polarization (DP) 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) Nyquist-WDM systems. Based on the innovative technique of approximate calculation of Euclidean distance, the competitive performance is obtained in terms of pattern-dependent impairments mitigation. Besides, the computational complexity (CC) is drastically reduced to about 34%, as the multiplier of the proposed MAP detection is completely removed. Comprehensive simulation results of triple-carrier Nyquist DP 16-QAM demonstrate that the MAP scheme could effectively mitigate the tight filtering and fiber nonlinearity impairments with much lower CC, i.e., achieve desirable SE and nonlinearity tolerance in long-haul transmissions. In addition, a 1.1 dB reduction of the required OSNR and 2.6 dB launch power range extension are observed in the triple-carrier 480 Gb/s Nyquist DP 16-QAM back-to-back and 700 km transmission experiments, respectively.

This paper aims to improve the trapped field by changing the size of soft-iron yoke, which are generally used to extend the pulse width. When a phi 60-mm GdBCO bulk was magnetized using phi 64-mm and phi 80-mm yokes, the maximum flux density and total magnetic flux of large yoke were 13% and 23% higher than those of small one, respectively.

Shapes are represented using signed distance functions, while deformations are modeled by cubic B-splines. In a variational framework, an incremental free form deformation strategy is adopted to handle smooth deformations through an adaptive size control lattice grid. The grid control points are estimated by a closed-form solution which avoids the gradient descent iterations. However, even this solution is very far from real time. We show in detail that such an algorithm is computationally expensive with a time complexity of O(NCPxNCP2X2Y2) where NCPx and NCP are the grid lattice resolution parameters in the shape domain of size XxY. Moreover, the problem becomes more time-consuming with the increase in the number of control points because this requires the execution of the incremental algorithm several times.

The finite element analysis (ANSYS Electromagnetics) has been adopted in simulation, and real radial-flux dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines have been fabricated in experiment to verify the study. Using the radial-flux dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines in electric machine systems can improve the reliability and obtain higher output torque. In electrical drives and control, a simplified model-free predictive current control method has been proposed and implemented to drive the radial-flux dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines, and the control law has been achieved by a TMS320F28377S microcontroller of Texas Instruments.

J,"Yuliani, E; Hendrawan, AP",EFFECTIVENESS OF DECREASING PERMEABILITY AND INCREASING SHEAR STRENGTH OF SANDY SOIL USING EXOPOLYSACCHARIDE BIOPOLYMER,"Sand is a type of soil with high porosity and a tendency toward a high permeability rate and low shear strength, which often causes problems in terms of piping and low slope stability. Permeability and shear strength have a very close relationship with soil stability. In this paper, we analyzed the addition of the bacterial producer exopolysaccharide on sandy soil for increased instability. The addition of this bacterial producer is expected to improve soil stability by reducing its permeability and increasing its shear strength. To find an alternative approach to overcome the problems of low permeability and shear strength, experiments were conducted using five types of non-pathogenic inoculated bacterial producer, namely, Lactobacillus sakei, Agrobacterium tumifaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas sp, and Nifrobacter sp, added to five samples of river and beach sand. After 30 days of bacterial inoculation, the permeability of the sand samples was tested using a constant head test, and the shear strength was tested using a direct shear test, which was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the permeability test, the permeability of the sand samples inoculated with Bacillus subtilis was reduced the most at 74.43%. Based on the direct shear test, the highest increase in shear strength, i.e., about 58.91%, was in the samples inoculated with Lactobacillus sakei. SEM photographs with 10,000 x magnification showed the presence of bacteria and the formation of extracellular polysaccharides in the walls of the sand, which affected the permeability reduction rate and increased the shear strength of the sand samples. Based on the permeability and shear strength results, it can be seen that the correlation between the two is weak, and thus when the shear strength of the sample increases, the permeability does not necessarily decrease; the correlation depends on the type and characteristics of the bacterial producer.",10.21660/2019.64.63608

Specifically, the nonlinear relationship between data is explored adequately through mapping data from original low-dimensional space to kernel space. Meanwhile, the subspace learning technique is leveraged to preserve available information of local structure in ambient space. Last, by restricting the sparsity of the coefficient matrix, the weight of some features is 0.

In three-dimensional DNS, transition is triggered by periodic blow-and-suction disturbances. Numerical experiments show that phase randomness of the disturbance is not necessary to trigger the transition which can be induced by disturbances with fixed phases. In a range of time fundamental frequency of disturbance, when increasing the frequency, transition moves downstream. When time fundamental frequency is big enough, transition disappears. With fixed space phases, time phases and selected time fundamental frequency, time averaged pressure and Stanton number distributions of three-dimensional DNS coincide with the experimental datum. Averaged velocity and temperature, Root-Mean-squares (RMS) of velocity pulse,temperature pulse, Reynolds shear stress and heat flux are extracted from the DNS database. All statistics agree well with experimental and theoretical results which verify the accuracy of present database.",10.1515/tjj-2016-0082
J,"Zhu, HL; Bi, DW; Xie, X; Hu, ZY; Zhang, ZX; Zou, SC",The analysis of the anomalous hot-carrier effect in partially depleted SOI pMOSFETs fabricated on modified wafer,The anomalous hot-carrier effect in partially depleted SOI pMOSFETs fabricated on modified wafer by silicon ion implantation is investigated and a theoretical analysis is proposed. The abnormal degradation and leakage current induced by hot carrier stress on the front gate are observed. The reason is that the silicon nanoclusters formed by silicon ion implantation can capture a large number of hot electrons during the stress. The effect of silicon ion implantation depth on this anomalous degradation is also investigated. Implantation closer to the interface of top silicon and buried oxide layer leads to more metastable traps and thus to varying degrees of degradation.,10.1016/j.microrel.2019.113509
J,"Zhu, ZS; Bo, YM; Xia, QY",Performance Analysis and Comparison of Two Deep RNNs in MEMS Gyroscope Raw Signals Processing,"Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has been a feasible and flexible apparatus for providing Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) information globally. In GNSS, the navigation satellites broadcast the signals to the earth, and the user receives the signals for PNT information determination. However, a standalone GNSS is not sufficient to construct a seamless navigation system, especially in some signal challenging environments. Thus, GNSS is always integrated with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for providing reliable PNT information, since the INS is able to provide moderate PNT information during short time. Micro-Electro-Mechanical IMU (MEMS IMU) is popular in the navigation community, due to its low cost, smaller volume and less power consumption. However, the MEMS IMU experiences complicated noise, which contributes the dramatically errors divergence in navigation solutions. For solving the problem and improving the navigation solution accuracy, this paper introduced Artificial Intelligence methods for addressing this issue. Specifically, deep recurrent neural networks (DRNN) gained excellent performance in processing time series. Inspired by this, this paper firstly employed a deep Gated Recurrent Unit- Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU-RNN) to model the noise with the aim to improve the accuracy of the navigation solutions. Two different MEMS gyroscopes (MSI3200, STIM300) from two different companies were employed in the experiments for testing the evaluating the proposed GRU-RNN, and a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) was also employed for comparing with the GRU-RNN. Following conclusions were drawn according to the results: 1) the employed GRU-RNN and LSTM-RNN were both effective for MSI3200 and STIM300 gyroscope raw signals processing. The results showed that the standard deviation (STD) of the noise decreased by 27.1%, 36.1% and 51.1% in MSI3200, and 37.5%, 60.0% and 57.1% in STIM300 dataset after processed by the GRU-RNN. The corresponding three-axis attitude errors decreased by 11.4%, 21.0% and 25.7% in MSI3200 dataset, and 60.0%, 36.8%, and 34.7% in STIM300. 2) Furtherly, GRU-RNN and LSTM-RNN obtained similar performance in both MSI3200 and STIM300 gyroscopes de-nosing. However, they both obtained better performance in STIM300 gyroscopes de-noising.",10.6125/JoAAA.201912_51(4).09
J,"Zigler, R",EVALUATION OF MASONRY GROUTING EFFECTIVENESS USING THERMOGRAPHY AND ULTRASONIC METHODS,"One of the frequently used methods of stabilization and reinforcement of historic masonry is grouting, especially grouting of cracks and voids in masonry structures. Determination of the properties of the injected structure, both in terms of physico-mechanical properties (with regard to the subsequent compatibility of the grouting mixture) and in terms of its condition and failures (cracks, voids, cavities), is a prerequisite for correct design and realization of reinforcement grouting. Minimization of interventions into the historic structure while performing surveys and the associated use of non-destructive diagnostic methods is one of the requirements for the remediation of listed buildings. Within the experimental research of reinforcement of historic masonry structures, the possibility of using thermography and ultrasound methods was evaluated and conditions and limitations for the use of these non-destructive methods were formulated.",10.14311/CEJ.2019.04.0041

Pulsed laser deposition is used for the epitaxial growth and focused ion beam was applied to open the lateral surface of the YSZ-MgO interface layers and to enable incorporation and diffusion of oxygen. The sample is annealed in O-18(2) environment to trace oxide ion transport with Al2O3 layers atop to block diffusion perpendicular to surface of the YSZ plane. Time-of-flight secondary mass ion spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) analyze the planar diffusion profiles. Diffusivity and surface exchange rate are estimated by SIMS data fitting.

J,"Schenk, M; Muetze, A; Krischan, K",An analytic approach for resource efficient parametric simulation of electronic circuits,"We propose a resource efficient precision transient circuit simulator approach without time step for solving the systems of differential equations. The method is notably suitable for optimization and worst-case dimensioning of small-scale electronic circuits. A closed-form analytic solution is computed for each of the electronic circuit states. Numerical integration is not required, and therefore, convergence problems are eliminated. An electronic circuit with only linear elements, for example, R, C, L and independent current, and voltage sources (LTI), is described with a system of differential (state) equations. Nonlinear elements, such as L(i), C(u), Diodes, MOSFETs, BJTs and/or PWM controllers are described with piecewise-linear models. Connecting linear and linearized nonlinear elements, results in a linear system of differential equations.",10.1080/09398368.2019.1697077

J,"Zhang, D; Wang, K",A Synthetic Feature Skull Descriptor for 3D Skull Similarity Measurement,"3D skull similarity measurement is a challenging and meaningful task in the fields of archaeology, forensic science, and anthropology. However, it is difficult to correctly and directly measure the similarity between 3D skulls which are geometric models with multiple border holes and complex topologies. In this paper, based on the synthetic feature method, we propose a novel 3D skull descriptor, synthetic wave kernel distance distribution (SWKDD) constructed by the laplace-beltrami operator. By defining SWKDD, we obtain a concise global skull representation method and transform the complex 3D skull similarity measurement into a simple 1D vector similarity measurement. First, we give the definition and calculation of SWKDD and analyse its properties. Second, we represent a framework for 3D skull similarity measurement using the SWKDD of 3D skulls and details of the calculation steps involved. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method by calculating the similarity measurement of 3D skulls based on the real craniofacial database.",10.1155/2019/8083504
J,"Chen, T; Gao, WJ; Wang, GY; Liu, XL",Study on the cutting performance in machining assembled hardened steel workpiece with torus cutter,"Torus cutters are increasingly used in machining high-hardness materials because of high processing efficiency. However, due to the large hardness variation in assembled hardened steel workpiece, the tool wear occurs easily in machining process. This severely affects the machined surface quality. Here, we conduct a research on the tool wear and the machined surface quality in milling assembled hardened steel mold with a torus cutter. The experimental results show the abrasive wear mechanism dominates the initial tool wear stage of the torus cutter. As the tool wear intensifies, the adhesive wear gradually occurs due to the effect of alternating stress and impact load. Thus, the mixing effect of the abrasive and adhesive wears further accelerates tool wear, resulting in occurrence of obvious crater wear band on the rake face and coating tearing area on the flank face. Finally, the cutter is damaged by the fatigue wear mechanism, reducing seriously the cutting performance. With increase of flank wear, moreover, there are increasingly obvious differences in both the surface morphology and the cutting force at the two sides of the joint seam of the assembled hardened steel parts, including larger height difference at the two sides of the joint seam and sudden change of cutting force, as a result, leading to decreasing cutting stability and deteriorating seriously machined surface quality.",10.1177/0954405419889200
