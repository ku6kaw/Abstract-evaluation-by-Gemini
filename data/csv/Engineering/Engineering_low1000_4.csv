We mainly focus on parallel and asynchronous solutions, however serial and mixed approaches are also discussed for the comparison. Practical applications are the motivation behind our in-vestigations. They include fast Kalman ""ltering commonly used in automotive active safety functions, for example. In such ""hers, numerous time-consuming operations on matrices are performed. An additional problem is the growing amount of data to be processed. It results from the growing number of sensors in the vehicle as frilly autonomuos driving is developed. Software solutions may prove themselves to he ins degrees cient in the nearest future. That is why hardware coprocessors are in the area of our interests as they could take over some of the most time-consuming operations. The paper presents possible solutions, tailored to specic problems (sizes of multiplied matrices, number of bits in signals, etc.). The estimates of the performance made on the basis of selected simulation and measurement results show that multiplication of 3x3 matrices with data rate of 20 100,V1Sps is achievable in the CMOS 130 nm technology.",10.2298/FUEE1904479D
J,"Doghmane, H; Bourouba, H; Messaoudi, K; Bournene, EB",A Spatial Pyramidal Decomposition Method for ear representation using local dual cross patterns,"In recent years, several scientific works are oriented to develop optimal ear representation, for ear recognition, which is discriminant, compact, and easyto-implement to ensure the best performance in terms of accuracy, computation cost, and storage requirement. In this manner, this paper presents a novel ear representation based on texture analysis framework, which relies mainly on Dual Cross Pattern (DCP) descriptor and Spatial Pyramid Histogram (SPH) method. The features are extracted using DCP descriptor to capture the textural structure then, the SPH of horizontal ear decomposition is applied to obtain the local information. The feature vector representations of ear image are constructed by concatenating all normalized histograms calculated at each level of the SPH method. Experiments conducted on three ear databases (IIT-Delhi-1, HT-Delhi-2 and USTB-1) confirm its performance compared to the recent existing methods.",
J,"Du, TB; Chen, CT; Huang, KH; Chen, YP",Development of an effective method for the separation of petroleum pitch using high pressure CO<sub>2</sub>,"Mesophase pitch, as an important chemical intermediate, belongs to highly structured pitch materials that has good property for conducting heat or electricity. Pitch can be naturally derived from petroleum or coal tar. Prior to producing the mesophase pitch materials, the removal of complex low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the original petroleum pitch is essential. In the study, we have developed a two-step process using high pressure CO2 for separating the useful part with desired properties from the raw petroleum pitch sample. Firstly, a stepwise supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) extraction process was employed for removing the lightest molecular weight fractions. The residual and CO2-insoluble fractions were further separated by a subcritical anti-solvent (SAS) process using CO2 at 25 degrees C and three high pressure conditions. A modified SAS apparatus was utilized in this study. The gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis system with standard calibrations was used to determine the molecular weight of various pitch samples. The GPC system was equipped with dual Ultraviolet (UV) and Refractive Index (RI) detectors. The polydispersity index (PDI) value of the raw petroleum pitch 6 (PP6) sample was 6.9, and it was reduced to 3.8 after the scCO(2) extraction and under the appropriate SAS processing pressure. The corresponding weight average molecular weight (M-w) was increased from 987 to 1493 g/mol. This study provides an effective separation and product identification method that only employs commonly used GPC analyses with dual UV and RI detectors. A useful screening method has been developed for selecting the most appropriate separation parameters.",10.1016/j.jcou.2019.04.009

J,"Ebel, M",VERTICAL WALL STRUCTURES IN TENEMENT HOUSES AT THE TURN OF 20TH CENTURY,"This article analyses the development of masonry, used extensively during the construction of tenement houses in Czech towns after the middle of the 19th century, peaking at the turn of the 20th century. The dimensions (wall thickness) were defined by architectural codes issued for Czech Crown Lands (i.e. Bohemia, Moravia & Silesia) in three waves - the first one taking place from 1833 till 1835, the second one from 1864 till 1884, and the third one from 1886 till 1894. Tenement houses belonged, without exception, to the so-called ""below-threshold"" buildings, where a wing was 6.32 m deep (later 6.5). These principles are presented in historical examples of selected works by students of the Prague Polytechnical Institute and architectural designs for Prague (Bubenec and Nusle boroughs).",10.14311/CEJ.2019.04.0055
J,"Elshenawy, MA; Abdelkader, SM; Amin, AA; Farghal, SA",Improved plug-play SV with virtual inertia for enhancing the stability of high RES-penetrated grids,"The synchronverter (SV) is currently one of the most promising grid-friendly inverters that mimic synchronous generators (SGs). Almost all the available SV use virtual current signal for synchronization, which require a complicated controller that lacks plug-play capability. This paper proposes a new generation of self-synchronised SV with a simpler controller, which provides plug-play capability with no need for switching between actual controller current and a virtual current for each ON-OFF process. The proposed SV (PSV) can also share the load with other SGs and SVs and also it is able to take part in regulating system frequency and voltage. A linearised small-signal model is derived for the controller to investigate its stability. The PSV is also validated through multiple simulation studies carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results show the capability of the PSV to achieve self-synchronisation and plug-play operation without a dedicated PLL or a virtual current. Compared to the current self-synchronised SV, the PSV guarantees a smoother grid connection and gives more accurate reactive power sharing. Moreover, the PSV is applied to a modified IEEE 14-bus test system considering three different contingencies to prove its impact on enhancing system dynamics and stability.",10.1049/iet-stg.2018.0214
J,"Emoto, T; Nozaki, T",Shifted Coded Slotted ALOHA: A Graph-Based Random Access with Shift Operation,"A random access scheme is a fundamental scenario in which the users transmit through a shared channel and cannot coordinate with each other. Recently, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is introduced into the random access scheme. The SIC decodes the transmitted packets using collided packets. The coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) is a random access scheme using the SIC. The CSA encodes each packet by a local code prior to transmission. It is known that the CSA achieves excellent throughput. On the other hand, it is reported that shift operation improves the decoding performance for packet-oriented erasure correcting coding systems. In this paper, we propose a protocol which applies the shift operation to the CSA. Numerical simulations show that the proposed protocol achieves better throughput and packet loss rate than the CSA. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the throughput and the decoding erasure rate for the proposed protocol by the density evolution.",10.1587/transfun.E102.A.1611

MMSE-based estimation is successfully used in optical tomography issues, like multiconjugate adaptive optics, where the problem is linear, and the phase perturbation spectrum rapidly decreasing. The implementation of MMSE developed in the case of multiconjugate adaptive optics has been applied to the alignment of active telescopes, although the forward problem is not linear, and the aberration spectrum different. Its performance is characterized by numerical modeling in the case of a TMA type large-field imaging space telescope, and compared to the classical Least-Square approach. The MMSE estimation brings a significant gain in terms of robustness and accuracy.",10.1007/s12567-019-00272-w
J,"Evran, S",Thermal Buckling Analysis of Axially Layered Functionally Graded Thin Beams under Clamped-Clamped Boundary Conditions,"In the present article, the critical buckling temperature of axially layered functionally graded thin beams for the first mode was studied under clamped-clamped boundary conditions. The beams were made to be three layers using functionally graded materials with ceramic and metal systems in the axial direction. Analyses were performed using fmite element and Taguchi methods. The beam configurations were designed based on Taguchi L-9 orthogonal array in order to detect the maximum critical buckling temperature and were analyzed using finite element software ANSYS. Analysis of signal-to-noise ratio was utilized to determine the layers with optimum levels and the influence of ceramic and metal materials in each layer. Analysis of Variance at the 95 % confidence level was employed in order to select the most significant layers and their percent contribution on response characteristic. The optimum result of the critical buckling temperature was predicted based on the 95 % confidence intervals of confirmation analysis and population.",10.2339/politeknik.498684
J,"Fabiano, B; Curr√≤, F; Reverberi, A; Palazzi, E",Generalized mathematical modelling of spray barriers,"In this paper, experimental and theoretical investigations on liquid spray curtains are presented, in the context of absorbing and dispersing hazardous gaseous releases. The problem of release mitigation by absorption, either in pure water or in aqueous solution, was investigated or analytically solved by developing a general approach. The structure of the model includes a fluid-dynamic model describing air entrainment rate both in still air and in windy conditions, an absorption model, predicting spray efficiency and a mixing-dispersion model for the evaluation of the overall barrier effectiveness in environmental control. The model was validated by means of replicated experimental runs in a wind tunnel equipped with spray nozzles suitable to create a two-blade barrier. The model agreement with experimental data was fairly good in both cases of water and reacting curtain, which is promising for short-cut design purposes. The developed framework can be applied to more complex situations and different gas, allowing, as well, the attainment of a more generalized approach for the design of a curtain, once given the release parameters, the site layout and the sensitive target specifications.",10.1016/j.cej.2018.10.045
J,"Faeghfar, H; Khanzadeh, M; Bakhtiari, H; Shajari, Y; Seyedraoufi, ZS",Microstructural and mechanical investigation of dissimilar joint of AISI 304L and UNS C70600 via pulsed gas tungsten arc welding,"In this paper, the microstructure and mechanical properties of dissimilar welding of AISI 304 L austenitic stainless steel and UNS C70600 copper-nickel alloy have been investigated. For this purpose, Tungsten-Gas Arc welding method with both pulse and non-pulse currenst and ERNiCr-3 welding wire was applied. The microstructures of different regions were evaluated using optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. The result showed that ERNiCr-3 filler metal has fully austenitic microstructure in both pulse and non-pulse modes, but in pulse mode, dendrites were found to be smaller than non-pulse mode. In both interfaces, between base and weld metal, partially melting zone was illustrated. Increasing grain size was more intense in the HAZ region of the copper-nickel base metal. In the tensile test, all samples were ruptured from the HAZ region of copper-nickel alloy with ductile fracture mode. According to the result of tensile test, tensile strength of the welded sample in pulse and non-pulse modes was 235 MPa and 268 MPa, respectively. The results of the hardness test showed that the hardness of the weld region in the pulse mode (75.3HRB) was slightly higher than hardness in non-pulse mode (71.6HBR). Minimum hardness number (17HRB) was related to the UNS C70600 alloy.",10.1088/2631-8695/ab5761

Here the generation of mode-locked MIR frequency comb in a LiNbO3 microring through optimized slot-waveguide design is proposed. Such microcomb can span over four-fifths of an octave (ranging from similar to 2810 nm to similar to 4630 nm) with pump power as low as 50 mW, which can be applied to the 2f-3f self-referencing for fully stabilization and helpful to monolithic integration of the whole system. Further investigations on complex dynamical processes for the microcomb generation suggest that the intracavity soliton drifting caused by the third-order dispersion could be compensated by the self-steepening effect as introducing an additional drift through proper dispersion tailoring. This work could facilitate the low-threshold broadband MIR frequency comb generation technique, as well as provide a way to realize more delicate control of soliton microcombs in both temporal and spectral domain.",10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2949313
J,"Farahneh, H; Fernando, X","The Leaky Feeder, a Reliable Medium for Vehicle to Infrastructure Communications","Reliable vehicular communications is fast becoming a necessity. Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, which is critical for safety, is often interrupted when vehicles travel in tunnels. Leaky Feeder (LF) or radiating cable have been the primary solution to provide wireless access in tunnels and mines, but being overlooked until now. The LF is a natural multi antenna transceiver ideal for broadband short rage access. In this work, we model the LF as a linear antenna array and derive the average bit error rate (BER) in Rayleigh fading channel considering Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and M-Array Quadrature Amplitude (M-QAM) Modulations. We consider maximal ratio transmission (MRT) at the transmission end and coherent detection and maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receiving end. Analytical expressions are derived for the BER. The effects of slot spacing and carrier frequency on the BER are also studied. Numerical evaluations show that the LF is a strong candidate for tunnels with much lower BER than a single antenna transmitter with the same SNR.",10.3390/asi2040036
J,"Farsi, M; Manshadi, MD",A State Estimation Method Based on Integration of Linear and Extended Kalman Filters,"The Linear Kalman Filter (LKF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as correction-prediction observers are two common model-based filters, which are widely used to estimate the unmeasurable states and parameters in the chemical processes. The main disadvantages of LKF and EKF are low accuracy and reliability of estimation and high computational time, respectively. The main object of this work is the modification of conventional Kalman filter to cover the disadvantages of LKF and EKF. The proposed method is planned based on the systematic updating the Jacobian matrix of estimator applied on the nonlinear systems. In this regard, a linearity index is defined based on the characteristics of outputs to determine switching time between LKF and EKF to avoid unnecessary updating the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the LKF and EKF considering four chemical benchmarks as the nonlinear state space models. Altought EKF and proposed filter present similar precision to estimate unmeasurable states, the proposed method has a lower computational time.",10.1515/cppm-2018-0051
J,"Feng, DC; Guo, CW",A numerical study on flow characteristics and rock stress in abrasive slurry jet impingement,"To apply abrasive slurry jet (ASJ) in rock drilling calls for in-depth understandings on the mechanism of impingement process. A fluid-structure coupling model that combines multi-fluid model and finite element method was established for a set of numerical investigation. The simulation results show that entrained air contributes to the divergence by successive disturbing on the jet flow. Subjected to the jet impact, the stress field of rock structure is affected by the standoff distance, abrasive particle diameter and crack in rock material. On the other hand, we adopt both first strength criterion and Drucker-Prager criterion for the elastic-plastic rock material to evaluate the stress state of rock under a high-speed jet impact. It is found the onset of rock damage is primarily attributed to a brittle tensile fracture at crack tip and a plastic failure in the crack front, tending to initiate from a smaller-length-scale crack. The flow field and rock stress are characterized to provide a numerical basis for the parametric optimization of ASJ impinging rock as well as other elastic-plastic materials.",10.1007/s40430-019-2060-9
J,"Filatov, AV; Filatov, NA",Portable Meter for Measuring the Modulus of the Reflectivity of Various Material Objects Over a Broad High-Frequency Band,A portable meter for measuring the modulus of the reflectivity of various material objects over a wide range of frequencies using a low-intensity noise probe signal is described. The operation of the meter is analyzed with the real characteristics of its high-frequency components and of the elements of the circuit taken into account. Formulas are obtained for estimating the deviation of the measured absolute values of the reflectivity from the ideal values. It is found that the main contribution to the difference in the deviations is from damping of the signal from the noise generator in the meter as the signal passes toward the antenna through the circuit elements. An adjustable attenuator for the generator signal is included in the meter to account for the damping. A way of reducing the systematic error is examined and the permissible values of the characteristics of the circuit components of the meter are determined.,10.1007/s11018-019-01687-x

The method is able to generate one or enumerate all optimum implementations, while the allowed target gate types and gates costs can be arbitrarily specified. Polymorphic circuits represent a newly emerging computation paradigm, where one hardware structure is capable of performing two or more different intended functions, depending on instantaneous conditions in the target operating environment. In this paper we propose the first method ever, generating provably size-optimal polymorphic circuits. Scalability and feasibility of the method are documented by providing experimental results for all NPN-equivalence classes of four-input functions implemented in AND-Inverter and AND-XOR-Inverter logics without polymorphic behavior support being used and for all pairs of NPN-equivalence classes of three-input functions for polymorphic circuits.

J,"Fong, LW; Lou, PC; Lu, LG",Passive Maneuvering Target Tracking via Nonlinear Estimation Fusion with Information Feedback,"In this paper, a federated filtering algorithm of nonlinear estimation fusion with information feedback is developed for a maneuvering target tracking using a multi-passive-sensor system. The algorithm that consists of a bank of local processors, a global processor and a pseudo-range estimator is designed for processing angle-only measurements. The pseudo-range estimator based on angle of arrival information is introduced to generate the tracking initialization for each local processor. An extended Kalman filter as a local processor is utilized for state and state covariance extrapolation and updating. For integrating the outputs of local processors, a recursive least squares estimator as a global processor is used to sequentially generate a global estimate for system outputs and information feedback. Computer simulation results show that the modified spherical coordinate state estimation convergence of each local processor is greatly accelerated by using information feedback.

The present work investigates the clarification of a synthetic wastewater of kaolin of Lara State, Venezuela, using poliDADMAC as a coagulant-flocculant agent. There were used two polymers of medium molecular weight (C-587) and very high molecular weight (C-595) To study the clarification it was measured the water turbidity of the water for different concentrations of polymers using a jartest equipment. Turbidity was reduced by 97% with both polymer, although the dose of C-595 was lower (0,15 vs 0,6 ppm). In addition, measurements of the adsorption of the two agents were carried out where it was shown that C-595 has greater capacity to adhere to kaolin particles surface than C-587.",

The paper concerns the influence of the resolution of images and the size of detected objects in pixels on measurements results. Test images of the objects of a known size were generated. The values of the perimeter of the objects were compared to the obtained values of measurements on the images with degraded resolution. The process of the degradation of the references images by successive downsizing the resolution, detection and measurements were performed applying automatic algorithm. The analysis of obtained results showed that the size of the analysed objects on the digital images plays an important role in reliability and accuracy of the measurement.

J,"Gaissinski, I; Levy, Y; Kutikov, D; Sherbaum, V; Rovenski, V",Operation Study of Miniature Air-blast Atomizer under Very Low Liquid Pressures,"Miniature air blast atomizers are intended for use in small jet engines. The typical miniature atomizer with rotating air outside the pressure swirl nozzle was investigated by theoretically and experimentally. The equations which describe the flow of rotating hollow liquid jet in a gaseous environment, where there is difference between outer and inner pressures of the liquid film were developed. The effects of surface tension, gravity forces, and inner-outer pressure difference on liquid film modes and its disintegration were considered. A set of the relevant equations was solved numerically. The initial conditions for the equations: pressure distribution inside and outside of the 'onion' as function of outer rotating air and liquid parameters, were obtained experimentally. The numerical results were verified by the experimental study. It was shown that exists two shapes of liquid film nearby nozzle exit - 'onion' and open film. Shape of the liquid film for the given nozzle pressure drop depends mainly on air pressure difference outside and inside the film. Two resulting spray modes are distinguished in droplet characteristics drastically.

However, a main disadvantage of these systems is the absorbent's crystallization phenomenon in the working mixture, which occurs when the absorbent concentration is higher than the saturation point. Among the aqueous working mixtures, NaOH solution shows several advantages for absorption system applications. The aim of this paper is to propose new mathematical correlations to predict or estimate the NaOH concentrations and refractive index in aqueous solutions (H2O NaOH) for an air conditioning absorption system application. The experimental measurements of NaOH concentration and refractive index were made in situ from aqueous solutions with concentrations from 20 to 50% (weight/weight %, with increases of 5%) and temperatures between 10 and 60 C (with increments of 1 C). Two correlations for predicting the concentration of NaOH and refractive index based on cubic regression models with R2 of 0.99704 and 0.99918, respectively, are presented for the first time. The normalized error for NaOH estimation using experimental data lies between 0.026 and 0.040, and for refractive index, the estimation lies between 0.002 and 0.001. Both correlations present a good fit to predict the NaOH concentration between 25 and 45% of concentration ratio.",10.1021/acs.jced.9b00536

The optical flow of noise and the object moving in the same orientations would have the same orientations of static feature for two frames image, that would disturb static feature point recognition. Because the translational motion optical flow orientations method judges with optical flow of single feature point and translational motion orientations, it is not reliable for static feature point recognition. Therefore, a 3D motion segmentation combined for static object imaging features recognition is proposed, which clusters the same optical flow of feature points in 3D motion subspace, including orientations and amplitude of translation and rotation. The simulation results show that the proposed static object imaging features recognition method improves the recognition correct rate and reliability of static features.

J,"Goncalves, RV; Teixeira, G; Torres, A; de Assis, AJ",Optimization of a Computer Simulated Styrene Plant by Surface Response and Environmental Impact Evaluation,"Computer Aided Design of Chemical Process is now a well established eld in the design of new process as well as in the optimization, revamp and retrot of existing ones. The use of powerful process simulators available today allows the process engineer to simulate even an entire process, but the majority of process simulators have only classical unit operations. So, if the process has a non-classical unit operation it needs to be simulated using a suitable computer language and further to be linked to the simulator. In this paper we addressed the problem of including a new unit operation in a process simulator and how to use the virtual plant to optimize and to evaluate the environmental impact of a chemical process. We used the free chemical process simulator COCO to simulate two styrene process production plant. The firrst one uses as a reactor a conventional PFR that is available in the simulator. The second plant uses a membrane reactor that was simulated using the software Scilab that was embedded in COCO simulator by using the CAPE-OPEN protocol. Then, we used both virtual plants to develop meta-models of the processes by using experimental design and surface responses. These empirical models were used after to optimize the plants and the results shown that it is possible to increase the styrene productivity up to 27.32 kmol/h using a PFR reactor and up to 30.56 kmol/h using a membrane reactor. Finally, we calculated the Potential of Environmental Impact (PEI) for each process using the WAR algorithm and we shown that both processes have PEI very similar. Therefore, the route that uses membrane reactor has an advantage over the route that uses PFR reactor since it allows to obtain higher styrene productivities.",10.1515/cppm-2019-0051

The remelted layer with activating flux TIG (A-TIG) reached the deeper penetration of 3.9 mm, the lowest secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of 3 mu m and the finest primary silicon particles. The hardness of A-TIG remelted layer was lower because of the reduction of hard Si phases, while the ultimate tensile strength increased from 163 MPa of the substrate to 236 MPa, which was considered to get the best overall performance.",10.1088/2631-8695/ab50f1

Oxidative phosphorylation includes the citric acid cycle and both are part of classical biochemistry and are sources of early interest in the mitochondrion. During evolution, mitochondria lost many genes to the host cytoplasm. Human mitochondria now have only 37 genes. Douglas Wallace has said it was the small size of the human mitochondrial genome that inspired him to investigate it, while everyone else in graduate school was hoping to work on an aspect of the Human Genome Project. That project had been proposed in order to completely elucidate the human nuclear genome: a challenge of approximately 20,000 genes versus only 37. Moreover, as he studied and worked, it was becoming more clear to him that the one-gene-one-disease theory regarding the nuclear genome was failing to meet expectations. Some investigators said it might be interactions of two or more gene mutations that explained intransigent human diseases. However, Wallace was convinced that nuclear genes, singly or in concert with others, were unlikely to explain the diseases that concern us most in the developed world, the diseases of aging such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancers. After all, his thinking was apparently, your nuclear genome defines the body you are born with. Something else appears to be involved when debilitating change takes over in middle age. In his career of, now, approximately four decades, Wallace has devoted his research to discovering the precise causes and possible cures of mitochondrial disease. Early in his career, he built a department devoted to the study of genetics and molecular medicine at Emory University in Georgia where he began on the faculty by teaching biochemistry. Subsequently, he moved to the University of California at Irvine where he built up an institute devoted to studying mitochondrial disease. Ultimately, he was invited to Philadelphia to build and lead the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.11.015

J,"Graffeuil, J; Escotte, L; Tartarin, JG",Impact of the Frequency Dependence of the Parasitic Admittance on the Diffusion Noise of a Diode Junction at Low Bias,"In this article, we report for the first time that the well-established diffusion noise can be apparently increased in large proportions and that such a situation can be very common at some specific frequencies in the p-n junction structures operating at a very low direct bias current. Noise theories and the associated measurement techniques are a major issue for the emerging semiconductor technologies, the development of accurate computer-aided design (CAD) models, and the designing of low-noise circuits and systems. The conventional shot noise model usually satisfactorily describes the p-n junction noise in solid-state devices, such as diodes and transistors. It has proven to be very efficient for many different conventional and advanced semiconductor technologies. However, alterations may sometimes be needed as previous works indicate scenarios where this so-called shot noise exhibits deviations from the theory, which translates into some noise suppression. In this article, we report on alterations that look like low-frequency diffusion noise enhancement (unexpected noise increase). It occurs at low current levels, for many generic commercially available diodes and the p-n junctions in transistors. Therefore, we propose an appropriate electrical noise model that satisfies both the low-frequency noise experimental data and the electrical behavior of the devices observed from impedance spectroscopy. We also evaluate this model as the ambient temperature is varied. Finally, it is discussed how this model can be connected to the conventional van der Ziel shot noise model and a better insight on the possible origin of such diffusion noise enhancement is provided.",10.1109/TED.2019.2947693

To understand the effect of a dent in hybrid composites with the inter-ply approach of Carbon and Kevlar reinforcements in an epoxy matrix, the damage tolerance estimated by applying a compression load in compression after impact test to the samples having with indentation produced in quasi-static apparatus using a conical-shaped penetrator. It was observed that the place and content of Kevlar layers directly effect on the toughness of composites which steered to the enhancement of the penetration resistance. The compression loading was given to the penetrated samples and then compressive residual strength calculated. The results revealed that the test sample of Kevlar reinforced epoxy composite presented a reduction of 32% in compression strength after quasi-static indentation and hence is more damage tolerant against indentation compared to other carbon-Kevlar/epoxy hybrid and carbon-reinforced epoxy composites. The samples submitted to compression after tests were photographed revealing typical crack aspects.

J,"Gustafsson, T","2017 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics presented to Marvin L. Cohen, Ph.D.","Quantum mechanics is arguably the most important physical theory to have emerged in the 20th century. It, in principle, explains nature on the atomic level completely, specifically the interactions between electrons and the energy levels of atoms, necessary to understand the properties of atoms, molecules, and solids, all the way to living things. The fundamental laws were established already before 1930, but applying them to real systems, observable in the real world, has taken much longer. This was due, at least in part, to the computational complexity of these laws, which can only be solved by making careful approximations. Once one has these results, one has to extract the physical important consequences. Marvin Cohen has played a central role in making it possible today to use these equations in practical terms to explain and predict macroscopic properties of materials. His pioneering work started already in the 1960s, when he used the concept of ""empirical pseudopotentials"" to make accurate descriptions of the optical properties of a large group of semiconductors, based on existing measurements (= ""empirical""). In the following years, the understanding of the interaction of electrons deepened, and he was in the 1970s and 1980s able to develop new theories and carefully made approximations that made the calculations independent of experimental data; he could truly start to predict the properties of materials by only knowing the identity of the atoms involved (""first principles""). The impact of this is hard to overestimate: It is now possible to predict the properties of novel materials before they are synthesized in the laboratory, making progress in the development of new functional materials much faster. Cohen has for 50 years been at the very forefront of this development, extending it to ever more complex materials. He has mentored a large number of young scientists, who, together with him, have continued to carry the field forward. Indeed, it is likely that Cohen and his intellectual descendants compose the most cited group of physicists in the world. Today, quantum mechanical calculations of solids are a large and ever increasing field, in size as well as importance. Cohen stands alone, through his contributions to the development of fundamental theory, to calculation schemes all the way to the application to real materials.",10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.11.008

Therefore, the purification of the solvents is needed to guarantee smoother operations. In this research, the flotation setup was investigated by means of laboratory and pilot-scale experiments in the amine reclamation for chloride and N, N ' -bis (2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine (BHEP) separation. The maximum removal efficiency recorded was 51% for the largest chloride concentration of 7091 mg/l and 37% for the lowest chloride concentration of 1536 mg/l. The mass transfer coefficient was hence correlated with the hydrodynamic parameters, including chloride reduction rate, bubble surface area, and gas and liquid phase concentration. The average chloride removal efficiency for the monoethanolamine (MEA) was more than 61% due to a better dispersion of pure nitrogen gas bubbles and formation of the tiny bubbles provided in the column. The results indicated that a higher chloride initial concentration corresponded to better performance of the setup. Under the typical column operating conditions, it was concluded that a collection zone H:D of 10:1 was a reasonable compromise.

Novel NTI-based acceptors with a spirobifluorene (SF) unit (SF-NTIs) were designed and synthesized. Their absorption range (400-600 nm) were clearly different from that of previously reported acceptor with a NTI-indacenodithiophene-NTI structure (IDT-NTI, 650-800 nm). Although, the SF-NTI with the same solubilizing groups as IDT-NTI (2-ethylhexyl groups) is not soluble enough for solution processes and favorable molecular orientation properties for OSC devices, the 1-hexylheptyl substituted SF-NTI showed a good solubility and favorable ""face-on"" orientation in the active layer films. The fabricated OSCs showed power conversion efficiency as high as 5.2%, and excellent thermal stability. These results indicate that the absorption of the NTI-triads can be tuned by modifying the central pi-unit and that their orientation nature and solubility can be controlled by altering the alkyl groups on the imide moieties. These properties allow us to develop efficient NTI-based acceptors with various absorption ranges.",10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107691

J,"Hanaoka, G; Matsuda, T; Schuldt, JCN",A New Combiner for Key Encapsulation Mechanisms,"Key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) combiners, recently formalized by Giacon, Heuer, and Poettering (PKC'18), enable hedging against insecure KEMs or weak parameter choices by combining ingredient KEMs into a single KEM that remains secure assuming just one of the underlying ingredient KEMs is secure. This seems particularly relevant when considering quantum-resistant KEMs which are often based on arguably less well-understood hardness assumptions and parameter choices. We propose a new simple KEM combiner based on a one-time secure message authentication code (MAC) and two-time correlated input secure hash. Instantiating the correlated input secure hash with a t-wise independent hash for an appropriate value of t, yields a KEM combiner based on a strictly weaker additional primitive than the standard model construction of Giaon et al. and furthermore removes the need to do n full passes over the encapsulation, where n is the number of ingredient KEMs, which Giacon et al. highlight as a disadvantage of their scheme.

J,"Hanes, J; Wiegand, RP",Analytical and Evolutionary Methods for Finding Cut Volumes in Fault Trees Constrained by Location,"Fault tree analysis (FTA) is used to find and mitigate vulnerabilities in a system based on its constituent components. Methods exist to efficiently find minimal cut sets (MCSs), which are combinations of components whose failure causes the system to fail. However, traditional FTA ignores the physical location of the components. Components that are close to each other could be defeated by a single event with a radius of effect, such as an explosion or fire. This motivates the search for techniques to identify such vulnerabilities. Adding physical locations to the fault tree structure can help identify vulnerabilities in the overall system. Using this information requires extending existing solution methods or developing entirely new methods. In this paper, two solution approaches were explored. The first executes traditional FTA software, then searches for clusters in the resulting MCS to find these vulnerabilities. The second uses an evolutionary algorithm to search directly for volumes containing components that form cut sets. Results show that the evolutionary approach provided better answers (i.e., smaller volumes) overall and is suitable to identify vulnerabilities caused by proximity of components. However, the cluster approach performed well when evaluating higher numbers of locations and may be suitable in specific situations. Potential refinements to both methods are discussed.",10.1109/TR.2019.2913746

Two different transistor configurations are considered, namely the central molecule directly coupled to the gate lead and isolated by a gate dielectric. The closed form expression for the voltage at which the transistor turns OFF, an important design parameter, is also obtained. Then, performance comparison is done between the two proposed configurations by varying the coupling energy between the side group states and the leads. It is shown that the dielectric separated central molecule configuration has much lower subthreshold slope than present day MOSFETs and much higher ON/OFF current ratio than the four level interference based molecular transistor.

J,"Hassan, AY",Enhancing noise performance of decorrelator detectors in multiuser systems using pulse position modulation signature codes,"Multiuser systems suffer from multiple access interference (MAI) due to the correlations between users signature codes. The decorrelator detector uses the inverse correlation matrix of the signature codes to eliminate the MAI. The major disadvantage of the decorrelator detector is the enhancement of the noise power at its outputs as mentioned in many previous works. This statement is not always true for non-orthogonal correlation matrix. The decorrelator detector can reduce the noise power at its outputs at certain conditions for non-orthogonal correlation matrix. If the sum of the eigenvalues of the non-orthogonal correlation matrix is greater than the sum of the eigenvalues of its inverse, the decorrelator detector will not enhance the noise power at its output. Moreover, the exponential of the determinant of the correlation matrix should be greater than the exponential of the determinant of its inverse. These two conditions are presented and proved in this work. A new family of signatures codes is also proposed to match the proposed conditions for the correlation matrix. The new signature codes are based on pulse position modulation (PPM). The paper shows that the new codes have three degrees of freedom to change the correlation coefficients between them.

However, almost all repositories do not have a straight forward method where metadata could be extracted for preliminary data processing being applied as part of the CRISP-DM process. Additionally, most repositories do not follow open access standards.

Polymeric coatings of optical fibers own viscoelastic behavior, so the axial tensile stress acted on the glass fibers depends on the time. After recognizing the exact viscoelastic performance of commercial polymeric coatings, the long-term tensile thermal stresses applied to the glass fiber of dual-coated optical fibers are obtained by viscoelastic theory. Following, the influence of thermal stresses on the fiber's static fatigue is evaluated, and the selection of dual-coated optical fibers to lessen the static fatigue is acquired. To reduce these long-term thermal stresses, the radius, Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, and relaxation time of the secondary coating should be diminished, but the strain ratio of the secondary coating should be raised.

J,"Hu, JY; Chen, N",Enhanced Feature Summarizing for Effective Cover Song Identification,"Self-similarity analysis-based feature summarizing technique (SuCo) was proposed recently to improve the time and memory efficiency of Cover Song Identification (CSI). In this paper, both the feature summarizing and the cross-similarity calculating strategies of the SuCo model are modified as follows to enhance its identification accuracy. At the feature summarizing stage, first, the Hubness Reduction (HR) strategy is adopted to reduce the possible 'Hubness' phenomenon existing in the feature subsequence community, which may affect the retrieval effectiveness. Then, the Network Enhancement (NE) technique, which was originally proposed in biology to improve gene-function prediction accuracy, is introduced to reduce the noise in the self-similarity network caused by the limitation of feature extraction and similarity measuring, and the inherent musical and acoustic variations. At the cross-similarity calculating stage, first, the summarized representative feature subsequences of the reference are concatenated to obtain its combined representative feature. Then, considering that the nonlinear recurrence property is important for describing the melody perception-based similarity, Qmax is adopted to measure the similarity between the combined representative feature of the reference and the unsummarized feature sequence of the query. Extensive experiments carried out on four open CSI datasets with 5 types of features and 2 kinds of representative feature subsequence choosing methods verify that: i) The proposed scheme outperforms the SuCo model in retrieval effectiveness. ii) Each of the above modifications contributes to the performance enhancement of the proposed scheme. iii) The proposed scheme achieves high generalization.",10.1109/TASLP.2019.2942157

J,"Hundertmark, F; Grotjahn, M",Automated design of structured gain-scheduling oil pressure controllers by modern synthesis methods,"This paper presents a new systematic approach for the design of a gain-scheduling-control system for the oil pressure system of internal combustion engines. Therefore, optimal linear time invariant controllers are designed at given operating points and their characteristics are interpolated by an analytical function. An optimization algorithm finds optimal parameters for a given linear controller structure with a fixed order and two degrees of freedom. To solve the optimization problem, constraints in the H infinity-norm are given for six different transfer functions of the closed loop. The same restrictions are applied for all operating points. For the gain-scheduling-approach, no classical superimposition of the output variables of the linear controllers is selected, as it is often the case with gain-scheduling-controllers. Instead, the poles and zeros of the gain-scheduling-controller are functionally calculated from the linear control loops depending on the scheduling variable. Therefore, the resulting gain-scheduling-controller shows the set behaviour of the linear controllers independently of the original operating points. A control loop that is independent of the nonlinearity of the controlled system is more efficient than conventional oil pressure control systems that use too high target oil pressures for robustness reasons. This results in increased efficiency of the oil pressure system, which can make a significant contribution to fuel savings.",10.1007/s10010-019-00334-9
J,"Hunt, JD; Silva, A; Abraham, J",Local Influences on Zonal Rents in Alberta: Implications for Integrated Modeling,"A hedonic price model was estimated for residential developments in the province of Alberta in Canada. The model is designed to be used with the Production, Exchange and Consumption Allocation System (PECAS) land use modeling framework, which forecasts future development patterns on each parcel based on developer return-on-investment functions, allocates households and jobs, and calculates economic benefit measures. In PECAS, base year rents by land use zone (LUZ) are a calibration target, while future rents by LUZ are calculated in a bid-rent allocation, so the estimation separates out local effects from neighbourhood (LUZ) effects. Local effects include proximity to busy collectors, light rail transit (LRT) stations, schools, and amenities such as parks, as well as local road and off-road access to the nearest network link. A non-linear treatment was required to separate out the value of land from the value of space, especially on large parcels at low intensities of development. A Bayesian approach was used to 1) incorporate prior knowledge from previous PECAS work in the U.S., and 2) to provide a model that can forecast future prices on any parcel in Alberta, even in areas where certain types of development are not currently sufficient in quantity to confidentally estimate parameters. The estimation quantifies the current price landscape in Alberta by LUZ, showing higher prices (and a tendency for future development, where allowed) in major cities, major oil industry locations, and national parks. It also quantifies the positive impacts of local road access, LRT station proximity, schools, rivers, and natural areas; the negative (nuisance) impact of being too near to busy roads and schools; and the depreciation of older buildings.",10.1177/0361198119857954
J,"Hyun, D; Jung, Y; Shin, Y",Selective Use of Stitch-Induced Via for V0 Mask Reduction: Standard Cell Design and Placement Optimization,"Multiple patterning lithography allows fine patterns beyond lithography limit, but it suffers from a large process cost. In this paper, we address a method to reduce the number of V0 masks; it consists of two sub-problems. First, stitch-induced via (SIV) is introduced to reduce the number of V0 masks. It involves the redesign of standard cells to replace some vias in V0 layer with SIVs, such that the remaining vias can be assigned to the reduced masks. Since SIV formation requires metal stitches in different masks, SIV replacement and metal mask assignment should be solved simultaneously. This sub-problem is formulated as integer linear programming (ILP). In the second sub-problem, inter-row via conflict aware detailed placement is addressed. Single row placement optimization is performed for each row to remove metal and inter-row via conflicts, while minimizing cell displacements. Since it is time consuming to consider many cell operations at once, we apply a few operations iteratively, where different operations are applied to each iteration and to each cell depending on whether the cell has a conflict in the previous iteration. Remaining conflicts are then removed by mapping conflict cells to white spaces. To this end, we minimize the number of cells to move and maximize the number of large white spaces before mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that the cell placement with two V0 masks is completed by proposed methods, with 7 times speedup and 21% reduction in total cell displacement, compared to conventional detailed placement.",10.1587/transfun.E102.A.1711

J,"Iliev, N; Trivedi, AR",Low-Power Sensor Localization in Three-Dimensional Using a Recurrent Neural Network,"This letter discusses a novel low-power circuit to self-localize a mobile sensor node in the three-dimensional space using a passive optical receiver. Self-localization of sensors, where a sensor node computes its spatial location by itself, reduces transmission demand, and improves real-time conformity of mobile wireless sensor systems. Our approach forms an over-determined system of angles-of-arrival (AoAs) to mobile sensor received from an optical anchor grid. The AoA system is solved with a linear program (LP) solver, which is implemented using a nonlinear feedback recurrent neural network. To solve the primal and dual LP optimization problems in the AoA system, we show a single multifunctional data path that does not require matrix inversions; thereby, enables within-sensor low-power computations to self-localize. Additionally, unlike other optical indoor positioning architectures, our approach does not require measurements of received signal strength and, thereby, is insensitive to power and alignment imbalances in the anchor grid. We show proof-of-concept field programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC simulations of our approach and validate its operation under noisy AoA data and for different numbers of anchors. An FPGA implementation in 180 nm CMOS achieves a peak similar to 0.12 mega localization operations per second per Watt (MOPS/W), while ASIC design in 45 nm CMOS shows a peak similar to 7.7 MOPS/W.",10.1109/LSENS.2019.2950335

J,"Jaberi, M; Pensky, M; Foroosh, H",Sparse One-Grab Sampling with Probabilistic Guarantees,"Sampling is an important and effective strategy in analyzing ""big data"", whereby a smaller subset of a dataset is used to estimate the characteristics of its entire population. The main goal in sampling is often to achieve a significant gain in the computational time. However, a major obstacle towards this goal is the assessment of the smallest sample size needed to ensure, with a high probability, a faithful representation of the entire dataset, especially when the data set is compiled of a large number of diverse structures (e.g., clusters). To address this problem, we propose a method referred to as the Sparse Withdrawal of Inliers in a First Trial (SWIFT) that determines the smallest sample size of a subset of a dataset sampled in one grab, with the guarantee that the subset provides sufficient number of samples from each of the underlying structures necessary for the discovery and inference. The latter is established with high probability, and the lower bound of the smallest sample size depends on probabilistic guarantees. In addition, we derive an upper bound on the smallest sample size that allows for detection of the structures and show that the two bounds are very close to each other in a variety of scenarios. We show that the problem can be modeled using either a hypergeometric or a multinomial probability mass function (pmf), and derive accurate mathematical bounds to determine a tight approximation to the sample size, leading thus to a sparse sampling strategy. The key features of the proposed method are: (i) sparseness of the sampled subset for analyzing data, where the level of sparseness is independent of the population size; (ii) no prior knowledge of the distribution of data, or the number of underlying structures in the data; and (iii) robustness in the presence of overwhelming number of outliers. We evaluate the method thoroughly in terms of accuracy, its behavior against different parameters, and its effectiveness in reducing the computational cost in various applications of computer vision, such as subspace clustering and structure from motion.",10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2871850

UWB communication system is allocated between 3.1 and 10.6GHz, which coexisted with the WLAN and WIMAX frequency bandwidths at 3.3 to 3.6GHz, and 5 to 6GHz, repsectively. The coexistence between multiple frequency bandwidths possibly can cause interference into the communication systems such as data loss and signal disruption. Thus, it is essential to eliminate the coexisted frequency bandwidhs from UWB spectrum. The UWB planar antenna is costructed with a radiator of an elliptical-shaped, and half-ground element which is subjected to suppress the frequency bandwidth for 3.3 to 3.7 and 5 to 6 GHz. Slits are engraved in the elliptical radiator and ground clement by etching the conductor elements. Slit shapes are designed in simple and optimized to realize the maximum band notch characteristics.

However, these bio-products are often present in solutions that are too dilute to be separated in a cost-efficient manner, and concentration by filtration is difficult due to their high fouling properties. In this research, challenging liquor, tannin-containing spruce bark extract, was concentrated by forward osmosis using soda ash from the soda recovery boiler as a draw solution. Soda ash, which consists of about 90% sodium sulphate, could be considered as a cost-free draw solution, since part of it needs to be discharged daily in order to prevent enrichment of potassium and chloride in the chemical circulation of pulp mills. Draw properties of soda ash solution were compared with the properties of pure salts, namely sodium sulphate and sodium chloride. Soda ash generated the same osmotic pressure and similar flux than sodium sulphate, but was a weaker draw solution compared with sodium chloride. When the draw solution concentration was 20% at 40 degrees C, the flux was 16 and 13 LMH with soda ash and sodium sulphate, respectively. Using FO, water recovery over 80% could be reached, which is double compared with water recovery obtained by nanofiltration. However, the salt concentration of the feed solution was increased due to the reverse salt flux of the draw solution, which may hinder the further processing of tannin-containing spruce bark extract.",10.5004/dwt.2019.24662

The influence of the reaction temperature, reaction time, concentration of silver ions, and addition of a protective agent on the size of the silver particles formed and silver coverage on the Al-Si alloy particles was investigated. The addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone into the liquid phase led to a reduction in the size of the silver particles and an increase in the silver coverage on the alloy surface. The optimum concentration of silver ions for silver coating ranged from 3.8 x10(-2) to 1.5x 10(-1) mol/L, and an excess amount of silver ions (0.3 mol/L) caused agglomeration of the particles. The coating of the alloy was achieved by the adhesion of small silver particles onto the alloy surface, followed by growth of the particles with increasing reaction time. Control of the thickness of the layer was possible by changing the silver nitrate concentration in ethylene glycol within a range not exceeding 0.3 mol/L. Silver nitrate concentrations of 7.5x10(-3) or 1.5 x10(-2) mol/L were suitable to obtain particles with a thin silver layer and high coverage.

Here a unifying approach is developed in terms of heat and mass transfer conservation laws to describe both phenomena. It is shown that the corresponding system of partial differential equations admits a self-similar solution for constant bubble growth rate conditions. The self-similarity solution is further simplified in order to indicate several asymptotic bubble growth regimes. The case of non-constant bubble growth rate conditions is treated only for the asymptotic regime of quasi-steady growth. Several results for idealized and realistic bubble growth cases are presented. It is shown that the two individual theories of degassing and boiling are unified through the appropriate manipulation of the bubble temperature. Small temperature differences can yield large variation in bubble growth rate in a small range around the boiling temperature. The system water-nitrogen is examined in detail and it is found to be outside of the domain of asymptotic theories (i.e. the complete self-similar solution has to be employed).",10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2019.106114

The present study builds on our previous work by incorporating (1) surface-reconstruction algorithms, (2) a rotatable holder design, and (3) a scan-path-smoothing algorithm to achieve conformal anti-radial scanning.ResultsAn improvement of approximately 40% in the normal-vector estimation is obtained with our new method, and the scan stability is improved by the scan-path-smoothing algorithm. 3D volume data of each scan are available.ConclusionsWe have successfully developed an automatic ultrasound scanning system for anti-radial breast scanning. This type of system, which has not been reported previously in the literature, can be an effective tool for fully automatic ultrasound breast screening.",10.1007/s40846-019-00483-w
J,"Lee, D; Kim, K; Pyo, S",Dual-band monopolar microstrip antenna using a quasi-circularly arranged mushroom resonator on meshed ground structure,"This article presents a new dual-band monopolar microstrip antenna with a meshed ground structure to improve the radiation performances. The quasi-circularly arranged seven mushroom structures are utilized for dual-band operation, which supports the resonances of the infinite wavelength and the TM modes. To improve the radiation performance, the meshed ground is employed and investigated by lowering the Q-factor of the resonator. The proposed antenna demonstrates that dual-band monopolar radiations at 3.298 and 5.709 GHz are in good agreement with the simulation results.",10.1002/mop.31961
J,"Lee, JE; Kim, MG; Jung, SY",An Efficient Power-On Base Pressure Prediction Inside the Tube Using Axisymmetric and Quasi-Steady Computation,"In this study, an efficient prediction technique is developed to investigate the power-on base pressure of a missile inside the tube during launch phase. Complex flow passage inside the tube is simplified using flow-path modeling. Base pressures on the missile inside the tube are predicted with axisymmetric and quasi-steady computations with a fully turbulent flow assumption. The computational results of base pressures for low and high thrust conditions agree well with measurement data of launch tests. Moreover, flow features related to the generation of the base pressure are demonstrated and discussed with the flow-field data for each thrust condition.",10.1007/s42405-019-00169-2
J,"Lee, MH; Shahab, MB; Shin, SY",On the performance of non-orthogonal multiple access considering backward compatibility,"This paper evaluates the performance of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system considering backward compatibility issue. This issue is considered by assuming that backward/legacy devices are incapable to perform successive interference cancellation (SIC), which is the baseline for NOMA systems. In a normal NOMA two-user pair between a cell center user (CCU) and a cell edge user (CEU), the CCU needs to perform SIC for data recovery, whereas the CEU does not need to perform SIC. Considering this, for the cell edge legacy devices, they can get paired in the conventional NOMA user pairing fashion, as they do not need to perform SIC being CEUs. But for the cell center legacy devices, they cannot get paired, as they are unable to perform SIC. In these scenarios, we evaluate the performance of a NOMA system, and investigate user pairing strategies to improve the system performance. Detailed mathematical analysis is provided to investigate the sum capacity of the NOMA system, followed by validation using simulations. It is shown through results that performance of the NOMA system in the presence of legacy devices can be improved through efficient user pairing strategies. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Lee, SH; Kim, JH",Magnetic Properties of YBaCuO Superconductors Fabricated Using Melt Growth,"YBa2Cu3O7-y (YBaCuO) superconductors used in energy storage devices are superconducting permanent magnets in bulk form. YBaCuO bulk superconductors are fabricated by interior seeded melt growth. Because the seed crystal growth is based on a slow diffusion reaction, long-term heat treatment is required to fabricate a single crystal in order to improve the magnetic properties of the bulk YBaCuO superconductor. We fabricated a single-grain bulk YBaCuO superconductor by controlling the distance between the seed and the upper surface of the YBaCuO bulk. The magnetic levitation force and trapped magnetic field were measured for the YBaCuO superconducting bulk. The correlation between the superconducting magnetic properties of the specimens and the microstructure of each crystallographic plane were evaluated.",10.1166/jno.2019.2670
J,"Lee, S; Choi, J; Song, KH",Liquid-Liquid Equilibria for the Ternary and Quaternary Systems of Water plus Trimethylolpropane + (2-Ethylhexan-1-ol/Octan-1-ol) + Formaldehyde at 298.15 K,"Ternary and quaternary liquid liquid equilibria of three solutions (water + trimethylolpropane (TMP) + 2ethylhexanol, water + TMP + octan-1-ol, and water + TMP + 2-ethylhexanol + formaldehyde) were studied at 298.15 K under atmospheric pressure. The consistency of the measured tie-line data was evaluated using the Othmer Tobias, Bachman, and Hand equations. The properties of solvents, such as distribution constants, separation factors, and insolubilities, were examined in the ternary and quaternary liquid liquid equilibrium systems. NRTL and UNIQUAC models were used to regress the ternary and quaternary systems and calculate binary interaction parameters. Finally, a comparison of experimental and calculated data, using the NRTL and UNIQUAC models, was performed.",10.1021/acs.jced.9b00519
J,"Legono, D; Rahardjo, AP; Krisnayanti, D; Hambali, R",IMPROVEMENT ON NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF 1-D FLOW WITH HYPER-CONCENTRATED SEDIMENT,"The flow phenomena in a mountainous area are often dominated by the situation where the streams have steep slopes and potential to carry the high sediment concentration. After the initiation of the flow with certain characteristic including sediment concentration within the flow, the flow would then erode and deposit the sediment in the next reach of the stream. Such phenomena would take place until the equilibrium state is met. The gradient of flow velocity, depth of flow, and sediment concentration are studied considering the equation of mass and momentum conservation, followed by the establishment of a linear equation. The improvement of the numerical solution persists in the form of the utilization of MS-Excel program as a technique of solving a linear three system of equations which was found to be practical. Such a technique was found to be effective to investigate the sensitivity analysis of the results due to some changes on various dependent parameters including the slope parameter. The three systems of equation and the proposed numerical solution technique offer further works associated with the hyper-concentrated flow through both numerical and physical model.",10.21660/2019.64.41812

To reveal periodic melt pool propagation effects that occur during laser brazing of aluminum and for a better understanding of those effects in laser brazing in general, this paper analyzes high-speed recordings of the brazing process with aluminum alloy. It is demonstrated that two main effects of periodic melt pool behavior in different frequency scales occur during the process, related directly to the wire feeding.",10.3390/jmmp3040083
J,"Leventeli, Y; Yilmazer, O; Yilmazer, I",Discontinuity Nomenclature and Its Significance in Geotechnics,"The trinity of the water-discontinuity-clay is the main cause behind most geotechnical problems involving rock slopes. The water molecule is unique to have a dipole property and is a common reactant in numerous chemical reactions. Discontinuity controls the slope stability. The planarity, continuity, and clay mineral infill are particularly important in the areas where outslope bedding dominates. The shear strength of clay mineral approaches zero upon saturation. The discontinuity nomenclature reduces the volume of the geomodel (GM) works, which comprise geology, hydrogeology, engineering geology, geoenvironment, and the geotechnics over 80%. The smectite-group clay minerals have a unit cell with net negative charge. Hence the water is readily captured by the electrically unbalanced mineral causing it to swell by more than 10% of its dry volume and then its shear strength approaches zero. The outsloping bedding, layering, or the basically imbricated thrust faults in places are the common examples of large-scale landslides. The discontinuity survey with the proposed nomenclature and approach is especially important in locating and orienting linear engineering structures. Consequently, this approach enhances the researchers and designers considerably in conducting projects conveniently in terms of timing, environment, safety/security and the cost.",10.1007/s10706-019-00984-0
J,"Li, BW; Liu, ZW; Gao, XR; Lin, YF",N400 extraction from a few trials of EEG data using spatial and temporal-frequency pattern analysis,"Objective. N400 plays an important role in the studies of cognitive science and clinical neuropsychology diseases. However, it is still a challenge to extract the N400 component from a few trials of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Approach. A method was proposed to analyze the spatial and temporal-frequency patterns of N400 in this study. First, resampling-average difference was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of N400 in EEG samples. Next, dictionary learning was utilized to adaptively select the wavelet bases corresponding to event-related potentials (ERPs) rather than spontaneous EEG activities and obtain the temporal-frequency patterns of ERPs. Finally, the low-rank constrained sparse decomposition was exploited to remove the spontaneous EEG activities and to learn the ERP spatial patterns, and the number of ERPs was also automatically determined. Simulation N400 datasets with different SNR levels and real N400 datasets of 15 subjects were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Main results. The results indicated that the proposed method accurately extracted the N400 component from a few trials of EEG data, and a significant difference of extracted N400 waveforms was observed between two experiment conditions. Significance. In the proposed method, the resampling-average difference significantly enhanced the SNR of EEG samples. Combined with the dictionary learning, the low-rank constrained sparse decomposition effectively removed the spontaneous EEG activities and automatically selected the correct ERP components.",10.1088/1741-2552/ab434c

J,"Li, GL; Wang, LF; Gao, YQ; Sun, W",Wave motion in double-resonator metamaterials,"A double-resonator unit cell is designed to achieve a locally resonant bandgap in the range of low-frequency in this paper. The characteristics of the wave motion of the double-resonators periodic structures are investigated both by finite element analysis and by vibration experimental analysis. The double-resonator periodic structure is printed by a 3D printer. In the double-resonator periodic structure, the low-frequency bandgap is realized in the case of a small size with a relatively hard matrix material. Both simulated and experimental results show that the double-resonator periodic structure does ensure the realization of local resonant bandgap in the range of low-frequency. Therefore, it can be predicted that locally resonant bandgap can be realized in the range of even lower frequency by using softer materials, while the unit cells are kept in the same size.",10.1088/2631-8695/ab5b79
J,"Li, JC; Zhu, B; Ye, XW; Liu, TW; Chen, YM",Two-dimensional deformation measurement in the centrifuge model test using particle image velocimetry,"The centrifuge model test is usually used for two-dimensional deformation and instability study of the soil slopes. As a typical loose slope, the municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill is easy to slide with large deformation, under high water levels or large earthquakes. A series of centrifuge model tests of landfill slide induced by rising water level and earthquake were carried out. The particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser displacement transducer (LDT) and marker tracer (MT) methods were used to measure the deformation of the landfill under different centrifugal accelerations, water levels and earthquake magnitudes. The PIV method realized the observation of continuous deformation of the landfill model, and its results were consistent with those by LDT, which had higher precision than the MT method. The deformation of the landfill was mainly vertically downward and increased linearly with the rising centrifugal acceleration. When the water level rose, the horizontal deformation of the landfill developed gradually due to the seepage, and a global slide surface formed when the critical water level was reached. The seismic deformation of the landfill was mainly vertical at a low water level, but significant horizontal deformation occurred under a high water level. The results of the tests and analyses verified the applicability of PIV in the two-dimensional deformation measurement in the centrifuge model tests of the MSW landfill, and provide an important basis for revealing the instability mechanism of landfills under extreme hydraulic and seismic conditions.",10.12989/sss.2019.24.6.793
J,"Li, LJ",Coupled mechanical resonators with broken Lorentz reciprocity for sensor applications,"Having simultaneously a high quality factor (i.e. a narrow resonant band) and a shorter decay time between the resonating system and the external sources (i.e. a wide resonant band) is a desirable characteristic for mechanical resonators, which however has been regarded as contradictory. This has been known as the limit of Lorentz reciprocity. We explore a configuration to achieve this desired characteristic within the mechanical regime. The configuration consists of a pair of mechanical resonators coupled together through their connecting part. One of them is encapsulated in a vacuum environment, and the other is left in the normal ambient condition. Numerical model of this configuration shows clearly the advantages such as: (a), sensitivity to the change of resonant frequency is greatly improved (the product of bandwidth Delta omega and the decay time Dt has increased at least two orders of magnitude); (b), the value of Delta omega . Delta t can be adjusted through the coupling stiffness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106329
